1j6diql,1741425714.0,"I turn 28 this year and I had the realisation that in the last 10-15 years I have changed so little that I may aswell have been in a coma this whole time. Everyone else in my life has experienced significant changes or progress in one way or another, while I am still the same depressed and unmotivated guy I have always been since adolescence.

Perhaps the only two changes for myself in that time were that I opted to quit my job and go to university about 3 years ago, after I got a girlfriend. But the thing is, Neither of those changes has led to much and honestly my relationship with my partner is probably worse than it has ever been, precisely because of my inability to change.

I feel no passion, no motivation, no desire to work on myself beyond what others push onto me as the bare minimum. I do as little as possible for school or the relationship then I spend the rest of my time playing whatever random game I took a fancy to that week. Its been that way since I was a teenager. My attention span is shot and my memory is gone with it, the few parts of my mind that werent broken have just rotted away.

My brother who is 2 years my junior recently got his first house, while I live with my parents who see me as nothing but a lazy video game obsessed lout. I always thought I was the smart one, the one thats good with money, but here I am with less than 5k in savings and no job while he puts down 140k for a new house. I think the worse part is I cant imagine working any job where I would be satisfied or happy. My studies are in a subject I figured would be easiest for me, something I hoped would spark some kind of change but honestly its just a drag.

I think I am just done. I dont see myself changing in the new few years and honestly it doesnt feel worth it. I dont think I have it in me to make an effort to change or even reflect on my progress and feel any kind of satisfaction in it. I dont want to be alive, let alone be an adult.

Im sure that something went wrong when I was being brought up and theres just too much broken inside me. Im a jigsaw that was missing pieces out the box, doomed to be left incomplete and thrown away.

Trigger warning: suicidal thoughts 

I have a rescue dog who doesn’t listen to me and only listens to my boyfriend, I only feel comfortable letting her out the cage when he’s around even though he doesn’t really watch the dog, I have a newborn and my boyfriend doesn’t understand my point with the dog and why I am scared to have her out when he’s not here. I live in a studio and she’s a big dog (pitbull lab mix)  who plays rough and growls at me when I tell her what to do and I told my boyfriend and all he says is I deserve to have her growl at me because I’m keeping her in a cage until he comes from work. 

I told him I do feel bad about the cage thing it’s just she scares me and I been super busy with baby and i have been crying a lot due to him not understanding and he sees me cry and just lets me cry and ignores me and goes to sleep. He says I should have got training for her but during that time yes I admit I should have got training for her but I was the only one working at the time and focused on buying stuff for the baby while I was pregnant because at the time I didn’t have support/family or anyone to get baby things for me or to even talk about baby things with me, I was alone in that sense. 

The dog climbs on baby stuff and tries to put paws in baby crib while she’s sleeping and I can’t have baby safely on bed because my partner insist on letting my dog on the bed and I been telling him my whole pregnancy to not let her on the bed because I want to be able to have baby on bed but he never listened. 

I asked him if he could stop calling me names like asshole and a puppet but he says I should pretty much get over it that we will say mean things to each other and should be fine since we are grown. He called me a puppet because I didn’t know what I wanted to eat the other day and says I’m a puppet in many other ways. 

It hurts me so much I spend my time crying as soon as he comes from work because he just doesn’t understand no matter how much I explain to him. I am 1 week postpartum and he has not been patient with me and not affectionate with me since leaving the hospital, he talks to his friends as soon as he leave works and get home, I asked him about it and all he says is he does it because he spent three days in the hospital with me and not socializing with friends so this is him catching up. 

He says he loves baby more than me which is fine but the fact he doesn’t even tell me he loves me since leaving the hospital makes it hurt me to hear. I truly don’t know what to do I feel so beat down, my newborn isn’t my stressor it’s him and it makes me want to break up with him or tell him I hate him cause that’s all I feel when he makes me cry this way. 

He doesn’t even help with our newborn he doesn’t even hold her cause he’s scared and feels unclean because of his job, he has made this first week so bad for me already, it feels like I am loving someone I don’t know anymore and it hurts so much he feels like a stranger. 

He is reminding me of the abusive home I grew up in with brothers and parents who treated me the same way and instead of physical he is just a men who is emotionally and mentally and verbally beating me down. I have never felt so vulnerable and weak as I do now. He wasn’t like this before baby came, he was affectionate until leaving hospital. 

This is all causing me to think about how my baby will be better off without me.

1j6d5az,1741424018.0,"Ive come to the realization that I've completely wasted my life. At 24 years old i haven't made any advances in my life and I feel like a joke to everyone. I can't hold a job or manage to find a career that I enjoy doing. I've had extreme anxiety growing up my whole life and it has caused me to be extremely Introverted to the point where I almost never want be around people alot. Because of this I have no social life, no self confidence, no ambition, and now I can't even imagine a future for myself. To make things worse I've never even talked to a girl or have dated anyone in my life and I can't even picture myself being with someone because of how unattractive and pathetic I am. I've gained weight over the years because of how much I was stress eating and anytime I do anything physical I sweat purfuosly and look like a completely mess which already doesn't help with my anxiety. 

I've been doing things to improve my life like going to they gym, educating myself more, etc. But I just can't get rid of this voice in my head telling me it's too late, that I already let so many opportunities in my life slip by and why should someone like me deserve a happy life. I'm a disgrace to my family and I'm not talented in any way. I seriously don't know what I have to offer this world apart from just merely existing and maybe I would be better off just not being here. 

I've lost so many close family members recently including my grandmother who i miss dearly and took care of me through my childhood and now my mother who has been the one women in my life who has deeply cared for me since birth has been diagnosed with anaplastic thyroid cancer which has a very low survival rate. As of this writing she is still with us but I'm afraid when it's time for here to leave I'm not going to be able to handle it. 

Ever since I was a kid I was never good at anything. I was never athletically talented nor did I  have high intelligence in school, always getting low grades and just barely making it through. I grew up in kinda a complicated household which is a bit much to explain but as grateful as i am to my family i was never pushed to take risks or try anything new. Whenever i tried something new and failed it would affect me bad to where i completely give up and just stop trying, which is a habbit ive seemed to have kept throughout my school life. I've made a few friends over the years but they have all come and gone and looking back I never even really stood out in any way. I've always felt like I was just there taking up space. My social anxiety prevented me from taking to people, taking any risks, or joing any teams, clubs, etc. I often ate food alone in the bathroom or in the library and I was seen as the quiet kid my whole high-school life. I was judge for many things like how I looked, acted, and I was always the butt of peoples. 

I know alot of this might sound pathetic to many which I completely understand. Despite all of the things i have done in my life in retrospect knowing it would just lead to me becoming a looser and a waste of space just makes me feel ashamed. I truly believe that I'm far from being anyone that matters and I probably should just.....we'll...put and end to it all. 

I'm also starting to believe I might be on the spectrum. I've never been tested or diagnosed with anything but after doing research and some patterns in my behavior throughout my life seem to line up with having autism or being somewhere on the spectrum. I wanna tell my family about this but I feel like a joke for just now coming to this realization and I don't wanna be judged for this but at this point in my life I'm getting tired of feeling like shit for everything I do.

I know this was a long and pathetic post and I appreciate anyone who took the time to read it. I would appreciate some advice or anything really. I hope you have a amazing day and once again I appreciate you for reading.

Despite applying for jobs every day for the past two weeks (and on & off over the past couple years), I haven’t been able to get anything. I have no real friends anymore.

I know I need new connections because my boyfriend is always off with his own friends and I don’t want to get clingy. Him and I aren’t in a good place. Things are toxic. We’re seeing a counsellor but the last few weeks have been hell for me. Today we were meant to hang out but he ended up working and then seeing friends. When I’m understandably upset he is usually invalidating. I feel so lonely tonight while he’s out, literally sitting here by myself trying to listen to music and have a drink to calm down but I can’t stop crying. I know I need to leave the relationship (haven’t even been able to eat today due to anxiety and stress, not just because of this but everything) but without friends, work and an income, I don’t have much room to move or distract myself. 

I usually cope by taking each day as it comes, just doing whatever I can, even if I’m feeling no motivation to do it. But it’s like I’m throwing myself out there and getting nothing back - over and over. I’m starting to blame myself, wonder what’s wrong with me. I’m seeing a psychiatrist at the moment.

I’m 19 years old and Im an extremely mentally ill and unhappy person. I’m officially diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I take Lexapro and I’m in therapy but it’s pretty inconsistent as i often have to go weeks without an appointment.

None of the medications I’ve tried have made any difference in my mood and it feels like i’m never truly happy and i’m either just content or miserable. I’ve tried committing suicide in the past multiple times and have been hospitalized. I get in these bouts of depression and when i’m in them absolutely nothing makes me feel better. I try coping in all of the ways I know how, including self harm, and my mood remains unchanged. When I get like this I have no choice but to just deal with feeling half dead for months on end.

I crave companionship and I’m in a relationship, but I’m constantly trying to push away everyone I love and ruining my relationships. It feels like I have no self control and I’m simply watching someone else take over my body. I severely hate myself and I dont know who I am. I’m extremely socially awkward, I’m very insecure, I get my feelings hurt very easily, every minor inconvenience feels like the end of the world, i feel like a failure, i feel like a waste of space. It’s so hard for me to just get up and start my day, every tiny task feels monumental. I’m absolutely terrible at dealing with stress. I have no self confidence. I feel like i’m never present in the moment and I physically can’t be because I’m always trapped in my own mind.

I just feel so emotionally numb and miserable all of the time. It’s been like this for years and it feels like nothing can make me happy. It feels like i’m actively trying to ruin my chances at happiness. I’m just so tired.

1j69i6i,1741409220.0,"This feeling is with me since I was a really small child. Even in nursery, I isolated myself from others and walked around or back and forth in the playground. Other kids seemed boring and daft, so I created my own world, games, rules, friends even. I didn't >see< them. I imagined them. Then I went back to reality when I had to or when I got too tired.

There are billions of photos of me just looking into the distance with a hopeless gaze. Again, even from nursery, there is a video when I lean my head onto my palm and watch others fighting for cake slices. Which were counted. So everyone was guaranteed a slice, there was no need for climbing on to each other. My face on that video tells what I think: what a bunch of idiots. But more like: what is the point of this?


For several years I had selective mutism, which means I didn't talk to anyone beside my family members. It got worse every year. I just went to school, sat on my chair and I didn't move or didn't talk until I had to. I just pretended to read or be on my phone, but I had nothing on my mind. I was trying to survive every schoolday. I did the absolute minimum with brushing my teeth in the mornings, sometimes I didn't even do that. I didn't brush my long hair, except when I washed it once a week. I tried not to shower as the touch of water 'hurt'. I didn't shower or took a bath for days. Probably I stank. In the very last year in my high school, the kids who were forced to sit next to me, moved their desk further from me. It hurt first, as it was done in front of everyone. Later on, I didn't care. 

After all, what is the point of what other people think? What is the point of being in school, to study, to even talk, doing anything, if in the end we are all going to die? Whatever lives we live, we all turn into ashes in the end. Of course there is no Heaven or Hell. I don't believe in reincarnation or even transforming into something else after our death. It is just nothing after that. A dark, blank space. Forever.

I was unconcious three times throughout my life. Two of those times were intentional. I wanted to see what was in the other side, if anything. I asked someone to chokehold me until I fall unconscious, and the second time I went through a risky surgery - secretly, I hoped would never wake up again. Unfortunately I did both times, and just confirmed what I knew: there is nothing out there. Nothing-nothing. Not a negative or scary nothing, not even a positive. It is just being blank. No memories of you have ever existed. There is no time, no place, no measurements of anything, no feelings. It felt like at both times I was out for only a second before waking up. Once it was 6 mins, the other was two and a half hours in real life.

If anything, this knowledge urges me to end all of this even more. To not to collect thing, not to attach to anyone, not to be interested in anything: because it just doesn't matter in the end. Whatever you possess in physical of metaphorical way, it will all be gone for you when you die. So again... what's the point? 


I go outside to be a witness of life around me, but I connect to nothing. I walk on the pavement, but it feels like I'm not there. My body is there. I function. I work. I have a partner. But  I am not really here. I do and say what I think 'normal' people would do and say. I can fake interest. Or sadness. Or shock, even. But deep inside me there is nothing. Nothing touches me really. Or even if it does, it lasts for seconds. Maybe minutes. But I fall back into this invisible dome around me and I become deaf and blind to everything around me. 

I don't see the point of going on. There is no point.

1j67yex,1741403851.0,"I am not actively suicidal. I've always had terrible anxiety but lately it's been debilitating. I can't stop overthinking and making myself spiral, until I'm shaking and panicking, to the point where I puke and faint. 

A few days ago I was trying to calm myself down, and the only thing that worked was when I thought about walking down to the river near my house and jumping in. It just put me at ease, I felt free, after hours and days of feeling absolutely trapped in my crumbling life. 

Since then I keep thinking about ways I could get hurt, or risky behaviour. I fantasize about being kidnapped or beaten by someone.

I always come back to thinking about the river, walking down there at night barefoot, submerging myself in the water slowly, fully clothed, falling asleep against the rocks there or under the bridge. 

The other night I was lying in bed at 3am, panicking. It felt like I was dying. I was nauseous and sweating. I put some clothes on, left my house, and went outside to puke on my lawn. I walked around barefoot, in the middle of the road. The cold air and pavement under my feet was good, and I kept thinking about what would happen if a car came speeding down the street at me. I ended up lying on my front lawn for over an hour. I wish I could have fallen asleep there.

I'm just so tired of worrying all the time. I hate thinking about other people. I like nighttime because it's like I'm completely alone in the world and nothing matters. 

I'm not going to kill myself. It would destroy my family and they're the best thing in my life. But I feel comforted knowing that it's an option, or a possibility.  

Does anybody else feel similar? Comforted by their suicidal thoughts?

1j67t7z,1741403375.0,"Hi Reddit, i have been diagnosed with adhd inattentive type, depression, and anxiety, and I’ve had a couple therapist speculate I have bipolar and autism. I feel so bad about myself all the time. I used to have a binge eating and substance use issues growing up and I’ve finally gotten a handle on that (by being sober). Looking back I don’t feel like I’ve been “myself” since elementary school. I’m 25 F and I don’t know if it’s “masking” or depression but I feel like I’ve floated to this point without being present or in my body. I have a job and close friends and a supportive family so I have a lot to be grateful for and I am. But lately I’ve realized how much of life I’ve missed out on by dissociating/floating through. I feel like I’ve been dead this whole time. 

The reason I post on here is because recently I have wanted to start being creative. I met some college kids who go to school for music and I felt truly envious of their talent and passion for music. I’ve also had to delete social media because I feel so jealous of others creativity or creative success, even for artists I love. I met an actor recently who was several years younger than me and it made me realize I have been numb this whole time and I could’ve been actually doing things (like learning an instrument or acting or anything). 

When I was a kid I loved dancing, writing, acting, and directing little plays. I don’t know what happened but I just stopped in 4th or 5th grade and I’ve been numb.

1j66p5s,1741399765.0,"I've [M23] moved away from my home for studies 3 years ago. Ever since, I've progressively changed beyond recognition.

I was much more social in high school. Maybe it was situational or to fit in, but 3 years later at university, not gonna lie, I barely leave my house.

I've cut away my friends keeping contact with them at a bare minimum. I will go on without calling, texting, or anything for weeks. This applies to people I've known for >10 years too. To be honest, when I think about it, I really do not care what's going on in their lives.

Over the last three years too my work ethic became much better. But it gradually went into the uncanny territory. I can work for 8-12 hours a day, every day, for months. This brings me loads of results I genuinely love. I like the intellectual satisfaction this brings. And I achieve a lot. But I think this also links to the friends I cut away - like, these people are busy discussing TV shows, games, sports etc. and I really just don't care about any of that these days. Despite cutting myself away I feel like before that I was able to give them attention and validation more, than they can ever do it for me. Kind of like having a younger brother where you're the one dealing with their shit, but can't have them help you grow cause they're at a different stage mentally.

I know it sounds bad but I can't help it, it's just that my feelings of connection with these people are not there anymore.

What's raising an eyebrow for me though, meaning it's maybe not just me growing older, is that this is a pattern with most people in general. I distanced myself like this from everyone. And while I do not feel lonely per se, it does make me dread a perspective of just staying alone forever. 

One thing I would suspect is the reason is that I became so hyper-focused on work that there is no space left. Another could be that I have had bad experiences with people in the past which made it easier just not to deal with them. Another would be I genuinely despise this place where my uni is located, and I want to move, so I don't even care about exploring it.

About the mood, I'd say it is slightly blunted, but emotionally I am still somewhat there. But I definitely don't have enough of a space to e.g. think about relationships (links back to me not caring about people).

I took therapy sessions, which helped me a lot choosing the right attitude and address the underlying issues. But now there is nothing left to discover about myself.

I am a pretty religious person, but this time I am not choosing to run to god to cry and solve my problems. I gotta face my fears and my challenges.. but it all ultimately boils down to one question, what is the purpose of this life and why I should do what I am doing? Is that the right attitude to live with? How do I keep myself motivated all the time?  
Hollywood, current events, mythology all of them feed to my apocalyptic thoughts. Feels like everything is coming to an end and a new cycle is about to start. Does that happen to all or it's just me? 

Folks who have passed this phase, please advise how do I cope up with this? How do I give myself the meaning/purpose.

I don't think I'm cut out for life. I don't feel like I'm fit in or in place. I am emotionally sensitive and empathetic. I don't feel like I belong. I can't find a job that pays a liveable wage. I have had a good amount of jobs for my age.  Don't have a driver license yet and I can't afford lessons right now but whats the point if I can't afford a car. Even if I work full time and make 600 a week I still wouldn't be able to afford one.

 I am in community college for accounting. I worked 30 hours a week at a pharmacy and made 400 a week still not enough. I can't afford anything and it sucks to know that this is how life is and I would have to work 3 jobs. I reduced my hours to focus on studying but now I can't afford hobbies or all of my needs and definitely not any wants. 

Right now I'm still studying but don't know how I will keep paying for college since my father is a tax evader for fafsa. I could do a payment plan but It will be all of my money. I binge eat. I don't have anyone to talk to. I have mental illnesses including depression and when I was on antidepressants I gained lots of weight and binge eating got worse so I stopped. I see a therapist and it doesn't help all they do is just suggest meds. 

My dad is dying and I never grieved my brother committing suicide. I'm lonely but a man could quickly make my life worse and more complicated. All the jobs I've been applying to virtually pay the same $12-18. I'm back to self harming. I feel like a failure and feel guilty for being alive. My parents are abusive but I don't want to have a victim complex. I still live with them and I am not able to afford to move out even with roommates. Maybe my expectations for earning is too high and my standards for life as well.

I went to beauty school to become a certified nail technician just to find that there's virtually no job openings out there for that near me at the moment. Or they are part time working 1-2 days a week. I'm considering selling press ons though but its a saturated market and I don't know who would buy from me. I have had 2 businesses ages 16-20 that flopped. Multiple hobbies that flopped and there is absolutely nothing that I am passionate about or enjoy. I don't enjoy entertainment either.

I'm not sure what to do with my life and how to feel better and I have been forcing myself for the past few weeks to forget every single thing and move forward but I genuinely do not see much to be happy about.

When I confided in my friend she said I'm privileged and my life is not that bad and they have it worse. I'm not doubting others have it worse at all. What prompted me to write this post is while searching for a new job because my current one I am very underpaid and staff is toxic and I am sick of abuse from the customers, I realized I still can barely find anything that would allow me to live that I got overwhelmed and cried and my mother said that I need to grow up and asked me how am I going to manage to survive which is true, and I don't think I will to be honest. She also said that me crying causes her stress and said that the stress I cause her and my dad is what turns them to drink. She says I make excuses which I think is true in some cases. I have been dissocoating for the past 6 years and every second every minute every week every month and every year passes by me in seconds. I will wake up one day and be 50 if i make it to then wondering where all the time has gone. 

I think the people in my life think I am weak which is true. I'm not even trying to seek pity or be self pity or a victim but I just don't see the point. I am not a victim it is all my fault and I believe any abuse that I have endured I must of have deserved it. I just get easily overwhelmed and I don't know why and I am immature. 

I don't know what to do with my life and I need someone to tell me.

1j644hr,1741391964.0,"As the title reads.. I’m in my mid 30s. I’m chronically suicidal. I have attempted a least a dozen times, somehow I tend to always stop myself last minute. I’ve overdosed then made myself vomit and went to hospital. I’ve hung myself but never from a high enough spot where I wouldn’t be able to undo it. All kinds of methods, but I somehow always end up only putting in 50-75% effort into actually going through with it. I’ve been 51/50’d at least 20 times but never “court ordered”. Usually in and out within a weeks span. I’ve tried a plethora of medications. I’m diagnosed clinically depressed as well as schizoaffective. I can’t keep a job longer than 3 months without having a breakdown or episode at work causing me to lose my job. I’m now unemployed again and living with my younger brother. I don’t have a car, no money. I’ve ruined my finance horribly… sure I can go out and get another job but in my heart I know what will happen… I’m sure I could get approved for SSI, but I can’t sit around for 2years or more waiting for a decision. I feel bad enough as it is freeloading off my younger brother. I’ve been homeless multiple times for long periods of times. I’ve somehow never fallen into the trap of drug addiction. Probably cuz I’m too poor lol… anyways…. I want to die very badly but I’m too chicken shit to off myself…. What mostly stops me is knowing how heartbroken my family would be. I know I am very loved. But that’s the problem. I get pissed off sometimes because I feel the whole reason I still exist is simply because someone loves me. I’m going thru hell everyday and I can’t kill myself because I’d break someone else’s heart. It makes me mad as selfish as that sounds. I wish someone didn’t love me because it would make it easier. The last thing I want to do in life is Hurt somebody, but I seriously wish Assisted suicide or euthanasia was accepted and possible for me… I fantasize VERY often about having cancer or some other terminal illness just so I can take the blame off of my shoulders for dying early. I’m at a lost for what to do. I’ve had “breakthroughs” after previous attempts where I felt like “okay, I’ll seriously give life a fighting chance! I’m gonna do my best!!!” And everything’s great for *maybe a year tops, but then I go on having delusions, one time cops found me walking along the freeway butt naked.. landed right back in the looney bin and back to block one again. Seriously, how can someone like me go about receiving euthanasia… I’m so tired… I can’t even type how I feel in my heart, but tired is best word. If this suicidalness was treated like another disease such as cancer, then at least I’ll have the dignity of succumbing to the side effect of my illness… good lord… I want to be at peace!!! SO BAD… my next plan is to dip out from my brothers house and go hiking off into the wilderness and who knows… maybe the vultures will have at me.. maybe I can make my death appear accidental.. idek.. honestly I don’t expect too many to bother reading this.

He hasn’t reached out to check in okay whole he is away. Which just makes everything I’m remembering worse.

I destroyed the only friendships I had left.

The disappointing feeling of being a disappointment


“There it is again, that funny feeling” - Bo Burnham


Who else is left in my life to disappoint? I think I’ve rounded third and headed home standing up. It wasn’t even hard, like playing T-ball while on a college baseball team. I made it easy for me by being the disappointiest disappointment I could imagine, and then everyone is disappointed when I showed them any glimpse that I could be otherwise.  Fuck what they thought, do I get a say? Yes, I do, and did. I made sure to make my choices carefully, and I always chose to be the disappointment. That’s a comfortable position to be in. Not much responsibility lies on the shoulders of someone that always disappoints in the end. Thats where I like to be, I look and feel like a person who can deliver, which is validating, and then I lead them down the long road of otherwise. 

“Welcome to My place. 

Oh, this little ramshackle? Ya, it could be nicer, ya it could be worse, but in the end does it really matter?” 
  “I know, right? So much potential, the things you could do with this would be amazing.” 

“But, I get it, its mine, I was born with it.” It’s not all its cracked up to be though, the depressions are literally almost killer.” “It does have its moments in time though where it sure impresses, few and far between, but there they are.”

The worst part of it all is I’ve disappointed myself, that’s where the rub gets hot. The blister right on the worst part of your hand and thumb. Right where it is sure to cause the most grief and pain.

1j61uff,1741385610.0,"I don’t know why I’m posting this but I have had a sadness ever since I was 8 years old, I am 25 years old now and I’m stuck thinking about when I was a kid, daily for 15+ years.

It’s killing me inside, I get so sad and nostalgic every time I think about it and I just feel so lost when I do it. I can never enjoy the moment right now or look forward to the future, I just want to go back, I don’t want to go forward at all. 

I have drifted everybody away from me because of this, because I can’t be happy. I’m so lonely and I don’t even want to make friends even though it would be good for me, but I can’t just enjoy people, I don’t like new people for some reason. I can get along with people well if we have same interests but I still feel some kind of emptiness which doesn’t bring me joy with new people, I just wan’t to have the same kind of friendships I had when I was a kid.

We moved houses when I was 8 and I struggled making new friends, probably because I hated my new ”life”, I just wanted to be back where I was before in the old house with all my friends and the same school, my life would have been much different than now.

I also think I am suffering from undiagnosed inattentive ADHD which causes my problems to be worse and I am waiting for an assessment for that and I hope that my life will get better with treatment but I just feel so stuck with everything. I hate my life and existance and I do not look forward to anything.

1j607wb,1741381336.0,"Hello, I posted a rant around 5 years ago when I was 14 thinking what I felt was invalid due to the rise of mockery of ""I'm 14 and this is deep"" content. Since then, I've done a lot of changes to my life. Started eating clean (wasn't easy in a junk food household, but I managed), gym 5-6 days a week, started a skincare routine, talked to strangers more on purpose, gained a good amount of weight (8kg) (no longer a broom stick with the strength of a toddler), started journaling on the regular, started reading books, learned how to play guitar, took art more seriously, took my education a lot more seriously, decorated my room to what I see fits, learned how to cook, deleted all social media accounts (except for reddit and whatssap. I very rarely use reddit), I barely touch my phone anymore, and changed my fashion to fit me more. In addition, I did all the research on my own with no support or guidance from my parents (they couldn't care less, actually the opposite, would get annoyed whenever I cook myself a homecooked meal when they bring take out). 

  
I did everything right, and all on my own. I should be happy, but I still wake up and go to bed feeling like shit everyday no matter my accomplishments that day. I am still passively suicidal everydarnday. I am actively looking for a drug (not naming) that's available over the counter, take more than 130mg and it can grant you an euphoric feeling. I genuinely think that's my last resort to any ounce of happiness. Doesn't help I'm belittled everyday by people who are uneducated. For example, as I said I was incredibly weak my whole life, I could barely do 10 \*wall\* pushups. I started strength training at 18, stayed consistent, counted every calorie, dragged my ass to gym on days I felt dying was a better option, now a year later today, I did my first ever full pushup with great form. I believed all  my life I would never be able to do that, I was so happy (first time in a while) that I recorded it again and proudly showed it to my biological father. All I got was the standard ""okay?....."" response, he said pushups are easier for women, because there's less weight we need to push (I'm 57.6 kg), and that he didn't know knee-pushups are a thing, they are useless, and that everyone should already be able to do full pushups, man or woman, with no training. Then got his obese ass up and did 10 full pushups (he doesn't work out, only during his teen years) and essentially laughed at my face. I went to my room crying. (this happens frequently).

Maybe he is correct? maybe what I achieve doesn't actually matter? This is all for nothing? I still occasionally hurt myself. I read so many articles and websites about how to improve your life, and for someone who sometimes feels like showering alone is running a marathon. I managed to do a lot on my own, yet it's all in vain. All for nothing.

1j5ym8q,1741377571.0,"Long and the short of it is, I have been depressed for decades, I have tried treatment after treatment after therapy. Finally, TMS and a new antidepressant combo did it for me. Probably not cured but it sure feels like it.

I was always told I was strong and it always felt like such a false platitude. I wanted to believe it but I couldn't. I felt weak and people told me I was selfish. And if you feel that way too, it's easy to understand why. 

But I realize now that it's true. The people who get up every day, the people who can't find the energy, you're strong. You may not fully realize how much weight you're carrying because it's hard to remember what it felt like to not be.

1j5yazp,1741376892.0,"I (26m) always try to stay optimistic, even with being in graduate school and having ADHD, anxiety, and depression. However, here recently it feels like I cannot do anything right and those “thoughts” are creeping into my head a lot more than I’d like to admit. It started in February when I hydroplaned on the highway on my way to work. I hit a puddle on the interstate and there was a car in the left lane so it shot me into the guardrail. The guardrail then threw me into the interstate and by the time I regained control of the vehicle, I had an 18 wheeler coming at me head on so I had to rip it into the median separating the east/west bound lanes. My airbags did not deploy when I hit the median. Thankfully I was wearing my seatbelt, walked away with a concussion, and no other cars hit me. 
I got my insurance check and bought a truck. Within 2 weeks of having it, I had to replace front bearings/seals/rotors, brake fluid, and get an alignment (3k). I have tried several times to get ahold of the dealership and they just keep sending me in circles. 
On top of this, my graduate school requires all professional assignments, midterms, and finals to be at an 80% or higher. I just “failed” the three midterms I had with a 74, 76, and a 79. So now I have to study all three again while learning new material. I work full time and go to school online in the afternoon.

I feel so incredibly lonely. I'm a 31 year old man that has recently lost his only friend. I say recently, it's been a month. But it doesn't feel like it. Time is moving so strangely. 

I pushed her away because I don't have control of my emotions when things get tough. I snapped at her in an argument instead of airing my grievance like a normal person. I was in the wrong, but it doesn't even matter. This was just the straw that broke the camels back. 

I don't know how my life has turned out like this. It just doesn't feel fair. In my darkest moments I can honestly say my entire life has felt like one uphill struggle. But I'm obviously not going to go into it here.

All my high school friends = gone, because I moved country.
The coworker I really liked = moved county and then ghosted me even though we got on really well.
My former childhood best friend = So rarely put in the effort with our friendship. When we (my brother and I) eventually managed to get him to do something with us we had a great time. But we both grew so tired of him never really being present. And in the end we had to end it.
My first ex = We had great times. But we argued constantly. Definition of a toxic relationship. I genuinley think that mess made me even worse at controlling my stress and frustration.
The best friend I just lost = It was a nearly relationship/FWB/normal friend weird situation. She was so, so great. And even though I wanted to know her for the rest of my life, things went downhill following the pattern of my relationships. What is odd is that for maybe the first 7 months of our 1.5 year relationship we hardly argued. But the straws just kept building up. I made one too many mistakes.

But those mistakes? Only some of them I feel like I had control over. I'm not a malicious person. I am just disaterous at handling stress. 

This really is just a stream of conciousness ramble. If it wasn't for my new job going fairly well I would be at literal rock bottom. Add onto all of this my brother and his mountain of mental health issues. 

My former friend recently updated her social media with a new profile picture and she looks really happy. It stings so incredibly much to know that she's moved on but I'm here trying to stop myself crying most of the day. 

Life just feels like too much right now. It's very dark. I wish I could turn back time. I wish I had answers. Sometimes when I hear a car door outside my house I can't help but think it's her coming to speak to me.

1j5v3q3,1741370023.0,"I’m 22 and recently started college after spending a few years working as a line/prep cook and eventually becoming a kitchen manager. I decided to pursue a mechanical engineering degree because I wanted more for myself—and for my fiancée of 2.5 years. We planned to marry after I graduated.

Unfortunately, our relationship fell apart during my winter semester. The breakup hit me hard, and since she was a huge part of my motivation, I found it impossible to focus. I withdrew from my winter semester, quit my job, and moved back in with my parents.

Right now, I don’t drink, smoke, or game. I work out 5-6 times a week, maintain a solid sleep schedule (10-11 PM to 6 AM), and keep busy by helping around the house—cooking for my parents and doing chores. Because of my exceptional standing (had a 4.0 GPA in my fall semester) and also due to my extenuating circumstance (break up, attempted suicide, depression, and medical referral due to these), the school has agreed to readmit me this fall and grant me a temporary break, so I have a spot waiting.

But until then, I feel completely lost, aimless, and pretty damn depressed. I don’t want to just kill time with a job or mindless work, I need to figure out how to live for myself. Up until now, everything I built was with the vision of a future with her. Now that it’s gone, I need to find a reason to keep going that isn’t tied to anyone else.

How do I create that drive to build my life for me? What should I focus on in these next few months to make that shift in mindset? She has practically been all of my entire young adult life, so I just don't know where to begin.

I’ve struggled with having a depression apartment a lot however in the last few months I got on top of it and kept a good routine to be able to clean up especially after a depressive episode. 
However, the last couple of weeks I neglected these habits a bit as I had a lot going on in life and whatever time I had to clean I spent bed rotting. 
This usually isn’t an issue now I’m feeling better I can usually easily just clean everything up however a few nights ago I saw a mouse in my apartment.

I know in order to call pest control or lay down traps I will need to clean my apartment first as that’s what’s attracting them however I am terrified to touch or move anything in case there’s a mouse underneath.

1j5t73e,1741366112.0,"My brain has been back at it this week and it's been a tough one. 

But - I started taking cold showers late last year to combat depression and I just wanted to share my experience, because it's helped me immensely.

I have zero appetite when I'm depressed and no energy (duh), and a cold shower in the morning for whatever reason makes me hungry and gives me a little boost to start my day. Enough that I can function.

I started, honestly, because I was out of ideas.

If you're thinking ""cold showers sounds fucking awful,"" yes, it kind of is. I think of it as ""pain consolidation.""

I started by just turning the water to cold for 20-30 seconds during a hot shower. It doesn't need to be freezing (especially important for those with cold winters, when the water is ice cold). It just needs to be jarring.

If you start wanting to do more, they say around 3 minutes is all you need. Sometimes I do 5.

On the days when I feel like a boulder is sitting on my chest, it will feel like the first time I'm able to breathe (probably because I am gasping). I'll want breakfast, which is honestly wild to me. I usually have to choke down something small when I'm depressed, if I can.

This part will sound insane, but it's worked so well for me that when I'm lying in bed in the morning (that fun phase of not being able to sleep but not being able to get up), it actually feels like a reason to get out of bed. A little relief.

 I have this constant anxiety feeling in lower stomach in the area of under my neval behind my hypogastric region. I would describe it like a nerve that gets triggered all the time 
anytime i try to do task i get this sensation in that area even stuff like responding to a friend saying hi or a mild task like picking up something from the ground or literally anything. It is really annoying feeling that makes me don't want to do anything just to avoid the sensation, sometimes i don't wake up from bed just to avoid it and sometimes i just want to set in a chair all day without moving because i don't want to feel the sensation.

I noticed that this feeling gets more intense if i didn't sleep well.

I had it for years now but i really don't know what it is, has anyone experience the same thing and what do you think it is exacly because it feels like a physical thing.

1j5n2r4,1741352595.0,"(Sorry but I rant a bit in this) Hello, I've never used reddit before really so I'm not exactly sure how to start this off, but to get to the point I am 18 years old and lonely. I know that's definitely on the younger side, but I feel like I'm a loser who hasn't done anything with his life. The last time I had a girlfriend was about 5 years ago and so as you can imagine it wasn't anything serious. Other than that, I have been living in solitude, I have only one person I can truly call my friend, and we aren't too close anymore. My day-to-day life is bad to say the least, I wake up at random and unhealthy times, I either don't get enough or get too much sleep, I don't have the motivation to make my own meals, so I tend to either eat unhealthy foods or don't eat at all. I don't even have the motivation to change clothes, have showers and brush my teeth sometimes. I often have thoughts of suicide and self-harm and how life would be easier for those around me if I wasn't here. I have a casual job but lack the motivation to show up to shifts and I believe I'm going to be fired soon; my money comes from a trust fund from my late father that I spend irresponsibly. I am addicted to smoking as it is one of the only things that brings me some form of clarity. As a kid the only person I had to raise me was my mother, as my father passed away before I was born. When I was around 7 my mother remarried but my new stepfather is abusive to say the least, I'm always being ridiculed, and I hear my mother and him talk about me and how I'm a waste of space and won't get a serious job or even show up to my job for that fact. As a child my mother was always emotionally distant as she had me when she was only 22. Due to this as a kid I never really had any interaction with my mother as she was always occupied with work and emotionally distant. To be honest I never feel happy anymore, I just feel angry and sad at myself and for being sluggish and unable to do something worth of meaning in my life, I feel guilty and lonely all the time; I am inside 24/7 and don't like socializing with others. I have been diagnosed with ADHD and depression and dropped out of school as I had no motivation to go, and it made me feel sick every morning thinking of the day yet to come. I was always getting bad grades, not doing my homework, not listening, not socializing and I just sat in the library alone during break. I don't know what compelled me to make this post, but I just feel as though I need to get this off my chest as it has been eating away at me for God knows how long. I guess I'm just looking for some advice from people here as I haven't had a good experience with talking to therapists and my mother in the past. Sorry for the big paragraph but if there is anyone who is kind enough to lend me some advice, I would truly appreciate it, thank you.",1,0,0,sorry rant bit hello ive never used reddit really im exactly sure start get point years old lonely know thats definitely younger side feel like im loser hasnt done anything life last time girlfriend years ago imagine wasnt anything serious living solitude one person truly call friend arent close anymore daytoday life bad say least wake random unhealthy times either dont get enough get much sleep dont motivation make meals tend either eat unhealthy foods dont eat dont even motivation change clothes showers brush teeth sometimes often thoughts suicide selfharm life would easier around wasnt casual job lack motivation show shifts believe im going fired soon money comes trust fund late father spend irresponsibly addicted smoking one things brings form clarity kid person raise mother father passed away born around mother remarried new stepfather abusive say least im always ridiculed hear mother talk im waste space wont get serious job even show job fact child mother always emotionally distant due kid never really interaction mother always occupied work emotionally distant honest never feel happy anymore feel angry sad sluggish unable something worth meaning life feel guilty lonely time inside dont like socializing others diagnosed adhd depression dropped school motivation go made feel sick every morning thinking day yet come always getting bad grades homework listening socializing sat library alone break dont know compelled make post feel though need get chest eating away god knows long guess im looking advice people havent good experience talking therapists mother past sorry big paragraph anyone kind enough lend advice would truly appreciate thank

1j5mjpx,1741351191.0,"Life has become so hard that I genuinely just don’t want to be here anymore. I’ve rationalized it, it makes logical sense. The pain and suffering have become so bad, any hope I had or desire to continue is just gone. 

It started my time as a firefighter for three years. Then my time in the army. My PTSD from what I experience gave me bad anxiety and depression. I’ve tried fighting it for years. Then in 2020 I got out. I thought my life as a civilian would be better. But it was tough. The transition didn’t go well, and worse, I started dating someone who would be downfall. She had borderline personality disorder. I would never wish this on anyone but she stopped going to therapy. She stopped taking her meds and kept drinking instead. 

The relationship became extremely toxic. Her mental episodes and suicidal ideations became worse. I had to wrestle a knife from her a few times and pick her up from a mental hospital. I couldn’t save her. She became emotionally abusive, exploitative. I spent over $50,000 over three years trying to help her. She never even tried to pay me back after many promises. Even after graduating college in 2022 she struggled to keep a job. I picked her up from the police to help her get out of her first DUI. I paid for her mother’s rent when times were tough. I rushed her to the hospital when she needed it but, months later when I needed to go to the emergency room she refused and left me to go to a tattoo appointment. It was horrible manipulation and abuse I didn’t realize at the time because I was walking on eggshells and trying my best to make the relationship work. But eventually she committed VA disability fraud to get a pension and then she cheated on me and left. She stole my social security number, she gave me herpes. I was broke. Rebuilding my life. I thought things would get better. 

After receiving messages from an emergency text on my iPhone (I was still her emergency POC) that she was in a car accident at 2:30am. She had crashed twice in 6 months from DUIs. I reached out to try and help. She said she was lonely. But when we met she used the opportunity to humiliate me and hurt me. I told her I still loved her and if she was dating anyone, to let me know so that I would stay away. But she actually was sleeping with multiple people each weekend. She went into explicit detail to make me jealous and hurt me. I became mad. I started yelling. I got out of her car and left. She used a few text messages saying I was reporting her to the police for fraud, out of context, to get a restraining order against me. I never physically hurt her and I never would have. 

Now, I lost my security clearance, my gun rights, I might lose my job. She cheated on me, stole from me, humiliated me and beat me down over years. I feel gutted. Empty. I feel like a loser. I feel like the world no longer cares about me, my voice, my facts. I was abused and taken advantage of by someone I just wanted to love and have her love me back. The past few months of dating is leading to nowhere. No one wants to date me.

I’m 32. Working a job I hate. Alone. Unwanted. I have a restraining order my record. I’m not needed by anyone. And I just don’t see any reason anymore to continue being in so much pain with no hope. People hurt me and get away with it. Maybe they have a point: I am unworthy.

1j5mcxn,1741350536.0,"Context: 4 therapists, 3 psychiatrists, 20 different medications, institutionalized for 9 days, 6 rounds of ketamine treatment, since 2023.

I’m sorry if I’m explaining things that are obvious, I really have not talked to many depressed people in my day so I don’t know what is normal versus unusual about my experiences so I will just try to be descriptive.

I’m literally depressed 100% of the time I’m not busy. I sleep 12+ hours every day, sometimes as much as 16, obviously not actually asleep that entire time,but rolling around in bed and doing absolutely nothing, I’m not on my phone or anything like that. But when I do get out of bed, if I am not actively occupied I will start to feel depressed, and that’ll get worse and worse throughout the evening (cuz I wake up so late I’m hardly awake for the ‘day’) until it’s 1 am and I want to scream because I’m just so overwhelmed and hopelessly frustrated with the misery I’m feeling. I can sit in class and not feeling actively depressed, I can hang out with my friends sometimes and not feel actively depressed, but I can’t only stave off those feelings for as long as I have things planned for a day. The moment I am by myself and unoccupied nothing can stop these waves of depression from washing over me. 

During these episodes I have almost no coping mechanisms at my disposal, I’ve tried meditation, breath work, all sorts of ways to calm down, recenter, distract, etc. but I have not seen much success despite persistent effort with different strategies over long periods of time. 

The only way I ever get some reprieve is by venting to someone. This gets really tricky though, I’m an 18 year old guy, and all my friendships are with dudes I really love spending time with, but there’s no emotional depth to our relationships. They never bring anything serious/emotional to me, and I’ve tried to bring serious things to them but it ends awkward and unproductive EVERY time. 

I have one girl friend in that I feel somewhat comfortable talking to, but I have had this exact same archetype of girl in my life 3 different times. Someone I meet and get close with, and then because they are a girl and I expect some more emotionality or empathy, I bring up my struggles to them. They are really supportive at first, and it absolutely feels like a breath of fresh air to have a listening ear with which to share my issues. However, my depression is severe, and the intrusive thoughts I have are scary, and as I gradually open up more and more about my problems to these girls, they get more and more scared/uncomfortable to the point where the relationship is torpedoed as a direct result of my sharing of my mental health struggles. 

It is my fault in a way because I am pretty unfiltered and harsh in my descriptions. The only way this venting is even helpful for me is if I’m really shouting about how miserable and extreme my issues are. I’m not even looking for advice, I just want someone to know how bad I’m suffering, it feels like my only tether to the rest of the world. Without these expressions of my pain, I feel completely isolated and unseen in my suffering. The trouble is, these relationships don’t eventually end out of mistakes or misfortune, they end necessarily. I WANT the people I share my emotions with to feel bad for me. After enough time, my communication with these girls will be strictly about my depression because I get more and more comfortable with sharing. What I share becomes ‘darker’ and darker, and it becomes so uncomfortable or painful for them to listen that they try and put up a boundary, but for me to adhere to that boundary, which might be telling them less frequently or in less detail, would be for me to receive no benefit from the venting because the only thing that feels therapeutic about it is how raw and unfiltered I can be. 

I hijack genuine friendships and make these girls nothing but just my therapist which gets exhausting for them. Though this is a pattern I recognize and would love to avoid it feels impossible. I NEED that outlet, it is the only reason I have gotten through some of my worse episodes, but it is just something that an 18 year old girl can’t be expected to handle.

I don’t know what else to do though, I’m not in a place to expand my social circle or support group because of what I’m dealing with, and I don’t have anyone in my family to go to. I don’t know what the solution is. 

In terms of treatment options, literally the only mainstream options left are electrically induced seizures and some magnetic therapy both of which my psychiatrist and therapist have expressed extreme reluctance towards. 

If I have no effective formal treatment and no one to talk to WTF AM I SUPPOSED TO DO

1j5m4g9,1741349719.0,"Even after 7 years of visiting therapists, psychiatrists etc, I never found a single doctor that would actually help me.
There is one psychiatrist that I hate the most though. I never wanted another psychiatrist, but I had to since I was getting diagnosed and I had to talk to the local psychiatrist for more details. Now with my diagnosis, I go there for prescription for my medication, and of course that I have to talk to him first. At the very first introduction, he immediately made me uncomfortable. He wasn't watching his mouth, openly talking about my self harm addiction and asking me many questions about it. Which would be fine, only if he wouldn't start joking about it. 
„you never cut deep enough to get sent to the emergency hospital? So that means that you have more like cat scratches? Oh that's nothing don't worry."" But that wasn't the worst he said.
„are you left handed or right handed?"" Since the question was so out of context I was confused and answered his question. „right handed huh...well roll up your left sleeve."" And then he laughed. I was shocked and wanted to cry myself out but I was too scared to do so. That was the first time we met and had a conversation together.
 
A few days ago I had to get another dose for my meds and inform him that my anxiety disorder is making it difficult for me to do basic daily tasks. I needed some medication to ease it down since I had only meds for my other disorder. But when I told him about my issues with anxiety and that I'm experiencing panic attacks, he just answered by „you need to take deep breaths and that's it."" After that he interrogated me about my self harm and if it's continuing, after telling him that I'm clean for some time he said „well now you can go out into strip club and go on a dance pole!"" It made me feel so uncomfortable and disgusted.
 
Please, is this normal? How should I confront the doctor about him making me uncomfortable because I don't think he takes me seriously since I'm just a teenager.

1j5krap,1741344381.0,"I (21M) have not really been happy ever. I grew up getting belittled by everyone around me, abused by an older sibling, treated like I'm stupid by both my parents and my other siblings, and I don't really have anything going on.

I wanted a doctorate, and to be successful in college or in writing, but I don't have any motivation to really do anything ever. I work a job I hate, and I don't think my coworkers would be too bothered either.

I'm not dating anyone, in fact I recently got broken up with (The girl realized she's gay, which I don't blame her for. She can't help that. I hope she gets a woman who cares about her the same way I did.)

I've got a friend group I play DND and video games with every so often, but I don't think they'd really be too bothered either.

My sister is better than me in every way. She's accomplished, and intelligent, has a partner, and is doing so well in highschool. She's making none of the mistakes I did, like she pursues extracurriculars, and socializes, and she's gonna go far. I don't think I will or can.

Meanwhile, I'm struggling hard in college. I'm doing the prerequisites for a bachelors in science, but I've hit a brick wall where the last few classes I need feel impossible, and I get paralyzed and feel completely lost when it comes to the work. I'll likely be dropped from or fail most of my classes this semester, and I don't even do full time at college or work.

I do have depression and an attention disorder. I've received medication and counseling for both, and it did not work. I think I'm resistant to the medication or something because it doesn't do anything.

I kinda want to just disappear, or pick a direction and walk in it without telling anyone.

The only emotions that I can really recall for the last several years are anger, sadness, hopelessness, or numbness.

I don't know why I shouldn't just kill myself if it's always like this. Anyone who I'm close to would get over it, my cat and dog would go to my sister. Anyone who would be sad would only be sad for a little bit, and then they'd move on with their lives and be fine, while I'd finally get to be free of this.

I've got a note drafted, and I'll print it off or write a new one because its pretty venomous, and I don't know if I'd want my last words to family and friends to be so harsh, but I don't know.

I'll elaborate on any situations I mentioned if asked, but I think that's the important stuff.

I'm just at the edge. I've been suffering from Social Anxiety since age 8, OCD since age 13 and depression at several times (13, 18-20, 26-today).  
  
Meds barely work more than placebo. Only think that works are benzos and they won't prescribe them in a dose that fits me (I know you develop tolerance to them but some people almost don't do and I seem to be in that group). Anyway, I barely can talk to doctor or even get doctors appointments because I'm just scared of people.  
  
Therapy has worked in the past in the form of extreme exposure exercises, which is the only form of exposure that works for me. I did the unimageable for a guy like me and I felt good, I felt like I was going to defeat this illness (why extreme exposure helped with my social phobia while regular step-by-step exposure didn't? because I', depressed most of the time and that makes me not being consistent, so extreme exposure worked because it gives you an euphoric feeling that lasts for a while and when I learnt to force myself into that form of exposure at least three different times a day, the high, which to ""normal"" people is their normal feeling but to us is just sheer paradise, would remain for most of the day). But I stopped doing it because of issues that happened in my life related to OCD and physical health and now I can't seem to start it again.  
  
I'm almost 40 now. I spent most of my life from 19 on isolated in my room. Two years ago I moved to a city and I'm working as a receptionist. It was that or you know what. And here I feel very bad, as my social anxiety is being reinforced by the social dynamics of the company and my submissiveness. I feel like the game is over. Therapists say I need medication because therapy doesn't work as ""I don't have anything more to learn from it (sic)"" and meds have been just a little bit above sugar pills for me, not including benzos, which work but only at medium dosages, which they won't prescribe me.

I feel like ending it all but I'm scared I fail and end up worse than I am now. I use the internet to try to be myself and escape my reality. I go to work, I go home, I eat and lie in bed, I wake up and go to work... And the weekends I'm just too depressed and exhausted to do anything else than isolate myself and stay in bed all day. I don't have any friends, because I keep running away from them. I just don't know what else to say. I just don't want this. I'm here, at work, faking a smile every time somebody passes by while I feel dead. I won't even go into OCD stuff.

1j5jfvf,1741338826.0,"Hi everyone,  

I’m reaching out for advice or insights about a situation I’ve been dealing with for the past two years. After experiencing a drug-induced psychosis, I was put on antipsychotics and antidepressants. Over time, my dosage has been gradually reduced, and for the last three months, I’ve been taking only half a tablet of Cypralex (escitalopram) and half a tablet of Kempro (olanzapine) daily.  

During my recent visit to my psychiatrist, I shared that I’ve been struggling with a complete lack of drive or passion to excel, succeed, or even engage in activities I used to enjoy. He mentioned that I might be experiencing something called **amotivational syndrome** (I think that’s what he called it—please correct me if I’m wrong). He explained that this could be due to one of three reasons:  
1. Drug use (I’ve been clean for over a year, so this likely isn’t the cause).  
2. Depression (I don’t feel depressed, so this seems unlikely).  
3. An after-effect of the psychosis I experienced.  

He believes it’s probably the third reason—lingering effects of the psychosis.  

Here’s the thing: I don’t feel like myself anymore. Before the medications, I had drive, passion, and a sense of purpose. Now, I feel like I’m just going through the motions. I want to get off these medications for good and regain the person I used to be, but I’m not sure how to do that safely or effectively.  

Has anyone here gone through something similar? If so, how did you navigate getting off medications while rebuilding your motivation and sense of self? Are there specific therapies, lifestyle changes, or strategies that helped you? I’d also love to hear from anyone who has successfully tapered off medications under medical supervision and how they managed the transition.  

Any advice or shared experiences would mean a lot to me. Thank you in advance!

1j5hndb,1741330776.0,"I am really burnt out at the moment and I think I've been isolating myself but I'm wondering if that's the right thing to do or if I'm going to make it worse for myself. I told my bf I want to break up with him and we're having a break of a few weeks now because we never do anything except watch tv and he's always too tired to do anything or if he's not then he just doesn't want to anyway. It's something that always comes up in our relationship and I don't think sitting around watching tv half the time is helping me, and when I try and get him to do things with me he shuts it down and usually upsets me by what he says. He's always very negative about everything and since being with him I'm just not happy like I used to be. It wasn't always like this, but now he doesn't want to get married or really start our lives together like he did when we first got together three years ago. I'm the one who's always pushing the relationship and I'm really tired, though I do still love him and we do get on really well usually.

I'm also pretty stressed at work and in my personal life and I just can't seem to get a handle on things. I started a new job last year and it was a huge career change, plus I feel pressure to learn to drive and move out from my parents. I have an autoimmune disease which makes things harder for me as well and it went undiagnosed for a long time which is why I haven't been able to learn to drive or move out yet. Due to being on a temp contract for half of last year, and then being made permanent, I missed out on actually taking holiday so I had barely any time off last year and that hasn't helped. My job has also been short staffed for around half the time I've been there. I have some pets too and they take a lot of time to care for which is all adding to my stress. My bfs mum has also moved fairly close and we have to see her quite a bit which is usually one of the weekend days a couple of times a month. She is very demanding and I feel exhausted after spending a whole day with her. My own parents are hard work as my mum is an alcoholic and has mental health problems and has just been made redundant and my dad just enables her. 

I have a week off coming up and my auntie wants me to take my pets and go stay with her for a few days which I really don't want to do. I'll have to ask my sister to take me there and my little cousin always makes me really sick since he's in daycare.

I really just want to withdraw from everything and catch up on stuff in my week off and not see anyone but I don't know if that will solve anything?

I am experiencing low mood through the week. It may start on one particular day then gets deeper across a few days. I get anxious attacks, not panic attacks but sometimes nearly overwhelming anxiety, which I have gotten better at managing.

Do miss back home but when I think of it I remember all the reasons I left 

I also hate commitment and am indecisive in the way that I say great potential in all options and possibilities I have around me that makes me feel like the other option is always the best

1j5fdds,1741322067.0,"This is a long one so I appreciate you for reading it. Just an average looser needing guidance/advice 

Been a Reddit lurker for about 15 years I have never posted. For reference I’m 28 male  6”3 a solid 235-250 depending on the day. (I know that’s a gauge people use  so I figured I’d add it) Not even sure how to get to the right audience. Anywhere here I go….


I don’t even know where to start. I’m lost and feel like a failure no matter what I do. Utter worthlessness. I try to pride myself in being self aware of my feelings but I’m at an impasse I guess. 

Here is some background on my current life. I have an absolutely amazing wife. We have a baby girl under two and another one on the way. I love being a dad and a great husband. Bought a cheap basket case of a house before the market boom and refinanced with a great Covid rate. Been doing a great job fixing it up. In short my living situation is for now…ideal.  I’m in central NJ making roughly 100k a year with my wife being a. SAHM. I’m blessed to be able to afford it but it’s not without sacrifice. 

More background…. I had a horrific upbringing that I don’t dwell on and to vaguely speak about it in a social media post is extremely out of character. I grew up poverty line with a very physically abusive father & uncle with an equally emotional abusive mother. Father tragically was murdered when I was thirteen. We were homeless for quite some time. I’ve been in my own since about that time. 

Now to the nitty gritty. I legit am never happy anymore. Thanks to my own hard work and dedication to creating a stress free life I can’t enjoy it. I legitimately don’t feel an ounce of happiness in what seems like my entire life. My wife? Amazing. My kid is great. I’m the first person in my whole family (I talk to non of them) to be financially stable. 
I’m constantly stressed. “Waiting for the other shoe to drop” it hasn’t because I put up a great facade but my greatest fear is it effecting my wife or kids mental health. 

To cope I’ve tried it all. Therapy didn’t work and I gave it an honest shot with 3 different therapist over the course is about 2 years. I can’t smoke bud as I’ve been suggested by a ton of people. I’ve tried all different ways over the years and I “green out” or have these crazy schizophrenic? Episodes. NOT an option. I really dislike alcohol but god damn does that do the trick for a short period of time. I have a few drinks I feel happiness with what I wish I felt all the time. I know it’s wrong but I don’t know what to do anymore. 

My baby girl, wife and child on the way need me but I can’t stop fantasizing about ending it all. I would never because of my obligations to my family. I’m just what I call “vibrating” with the sensation of my blood itching at all times. I just want it to stop. I’ve heard stories about alcoholics and I don’t think I’m there. It the only thing that helps but I really hate the hangovers and regret after drinking. I’ve weight lifted for the better part of a decade but can’t even bring myself to do it anymore. 

I don’t know anymore. I’ve never had anti depressants and to be honest I don’t want a crutch at all I just want to be normal. I fantasize about being drunk to feel normal all day but Seldom ever do since I dislike the taste and after effects. Maybe once a month tops have a few drink and once every 3+ months drunkish. 

I’m out of ideas. But it’s coming to a head for awhile. I need relief or I’m afraid I will do something extreme to feel relief.

1j5ebfc,1741318492.0,"I have had a rough couple of years with my mental health. Every day it’s a gamble with what I’m going to be like mentally. Some days are great and no matter how hard I try to hold on it still slips away. I constantly feel like a failure even though my boyfriend reassures me I’m not. I hated living at home for so long (I’m 24 now, lived at home since I was 23) so we decided to move someplace we both loved. We did it and I do love it here but I’m also alone, no friends, no family close by. That doesn’t affect me as much as the simple fact that I cannot keep feeling this way. 

I have thought about ending it multiple times but I know that would just be giving into it and I try to think I’m stronger than that. It’s just gotten so hard to keep going.

1j5e9s1,1741318350.0,"I feel stuck where I am in life right now, and have this restlessness, like I need to make a huge change in my life to get unstuck and enjoy my life again. The grass is always greener...right?

Except, I am fortunate to have lots of really good things right now. Things that *should* be the greener grass that I feel I need. I have supportive friends and family, two welcoming part-time jobs, my own space to live. I am a university student, expecting to graduate next year. I have employers offering me internships and career paths after graduation, and many great references and professional supporters. My partner of six years proposed last spring. 

I know many people would kill to be in the situation I'm in. And yet, I have this restless feeling. I'm not happy. I don't feel like I have a future. I'm exhausted, and unless I give 110% to get out of bed during the day, I will simply rot. I resonate with every post that wishes for the freedom of being diagnosed with some incurable disease, or for tragedy to strike and strip them of their responsibilities or even their life. I've wondered for hours about the best way to take my own life, and how I could do it with the smallest impact. I yearn for escape.

In this yearning, I've wondered what change I could make. Could I quit my job? I love my jobs and the people I work with, and seriously need the income. Drop out of classes? I'm struggling this semester, but I've already delayed my graduation by two more years than expected. If I drop out completely, I'll have wasted years of my life and be throwing away the career paths and professional connections that could set me up. I've even considered taking a break from my relationship with my fiance. I feel like I need space to find myself again, but I absolutely do not want to let go of the close relationship we have.

When I've talked to therapists, they agree that each component of my life seems to be in a good place and that I shouldn't drop any of it. No matter how I try to explain my feeling, they only ever suggest rest - which I know is, usually, good advice, but in my case I can easily sleep and be non-responsive in bed for over 3 weeks trying to get enough ""rest"". At some point the sleep and bedrotting becomes crushing, like I'm weighed down, and I cannot get out. This has happened before, and an extreme excess of sleep has always been a symptom I cannot get doctors to take seriously. All this to say, sleep and/or time in bed is more of a problem than a solution for me. Still, mental health professionals I have seen insist this is the only strategy I should try.

And when everything in my life is ""great"", what do I change? How do I get out? I can't keep living like this, I'm going to burst. Sooner or later, I'll make an impulsive change that I can't un-make. I just don't know what to do.

1j5dywu,1741317398.0,"I have been thinking lately about why I find it really hard to vent, and this is what I came up with.

The first reason is that I can't do it either because I struggle to find the words to describe exactly how I am feeling, and when I try, the words I use feel shallow, or because I feel ashamed of my problems. I always blame myself for them and feel guilty, or I fear the consequences of talking like being a burden to someone, them judging me, leaving me for it, or hurting me somehow.

The second reason is that I don't always have a valid reason for my sadness, anger, anxiety, or whatever I am feeling.

The third reason is that I feel like no one really cares, and those who do, even a little, don’t deserve to bear my shit.

I sympathize with everyone and love them even if I don't know them just because I understand them while I don't find any shoulder to support my shoulder I really always wonder why this happens to me I'm not a bad person I don't even drink alcohol or take any drugs I don't offend others the only bad habit I do is that I'm a smoker so why does all this happen to me This question is always in my mind If there's one thing I've learned from depression is to bury all the painful things inside me Not because I'm Superman but because I'm a lonely man

But I still believe in some things that some people think are superficial like love can heal and that's not superficial those are pure feelings

We have known each other on the deepest level and we are attached too much. He has, maybe, an avoidant attachment to me where when conflicts arise he shuts off so bad that i(an anxious fool) keep reaching out ignoring my hurt, to love him and not lose him. Recently we got out US visa approved and he came to pick me up but my passport didn’t arrive so we had to book a hotel until we got it but the passport delivery got delayed to 5 days from then and he had work and he didn’t want to be there so he asked if he could go and i should go back to my family. Funny he said it because i left my family(without telling them because they wouldn’t agree to our same sex relationship) i told him he is my family and he could have asked me to to back for a bit and we will figure things out instead of saying “i think you should return to your family” he has been avoidant whenever he leaves me after seeing me in person(i know it sounds weird but he is my everything and i know why he acts this way). I love this man from the depths of my heart. It’s been two weeks since we fought i said mean things(i hate myself for it) and i apologized over and over and he has also taken the ring back before so i had that in my heart and i took it out now even though i forgave him for it.

I have a fear of abandonment especially when it comes to him. I can’t stay away from him much and he used to be that way too until now. He said he is hesitant and scared but why doesn’t he block me then, why does he pick up my call(however doesn’t reply to my messages much). Im losing myself over it.

1j5d1dr,1741314456.0,"i worked so hard to get out of this, been there couple of times with each phase lasting months, and me getting older everytime, everything gets realer. If you’d ask me yesterday i was a happy grateful man, today (sorry it may be weird but i am anonym here and i js wanna get the truth out) i jerked a couple times not being able to hold myswlf back. and then took some large hits of my vape after 24h no nicotine.
then i shifted back into this severely depressed state.

quick backstory:
- its ramadan rn, i am fasting. I am not sipping lean, no benadryl, no other pills or anything to get high. Going strong. I also said i wont jerk off easy and i might try to not smoke. Failed the last two miserably.
-i have a super fake life
-i was never loved
-i never wanted to live, i dont and wont understand my purpose. i will get old and work or make something okay but i would rather not i js dont care and never cared. never felt love - dont get me wrong i have a loving family but i love them too much to tell about this, i never did and never will (i somewhat tried a yesr ago and as i thought everything came out worse and i played it off like it was another sleepless day and a joke)
-i am clean from weed for 8 months after being addicted to it couple of months
-still smoking nicotine since 3 years
-quit gambling succesfully 3 months ago, after gambling for 1,5 years (1month i gambled, 1,4years i tried to quit) after going into debt in 2 bank accounts, over 1000 euros in debt on paypal, at 16 years old. 
- im 18 years old
-im broke asf, i finally found a job earlier today after searching for one for 2 years, and also am still in school for 2,5 more years (going bad still)

idk what to say i just distract myself from reality 24/7 but sometimes i just get shifted back to reality.
its like i injected reality into my veins everything is real again, i hate everything again i dont want to live
everyone is fake - no counterargument on that is possible

i wanted to do so much shit, i did nothing,
all day every day, repeat the cycle, everyday

i only got diagnosed with adhd 13 years ago and been taking ritalin for it, kept my mouth shut to anyone wbt whats going on

i believe being alive and everything about life is cringe 

only reason i dont kill myself is that i have a loving family and uncles and grandparents etc. thats the only thing i care about because theyre so pure no matter what they do - they may be fake but idc they are the only ones im the closest to trusting with my love

idk what to do 
idek what my problem is atp, i thought it was:
1- me being fat
2- me beinng never loved by a girl
3- me being broke

1- i stopped eating completely and lost 25kg in 2 months, and i was lean, still nothing changed

2- i didnt find out

3- i mean yeah if i had good money i probably wouldnt ever be depressed cuz i can feed my family and people i wanna love, but id rather not live than go through thr hustle of life and make money.

my family had a really hard time before i was born with my soblings, cuz of deaths amd suicides, even tho theyre the best parents, besides being super strict on some topics, which i kinda understand
f.e: i wouldnt want my son or daughter to kill himself and do drugs and steal either
and i wouldnt care too much if he was a criminal as long as hes ok and not hurting anyone without any proper reason

well anyways what can i do to get a aberage to good real life, cuz i cant keeep distracting myself while sober, (besides nicotine, which aint a problem really, but even if it is i cannot quit) and even if i am not sober i only take mainly codeine diphenhydramine and a speedy ritalin-caffeine mix up my nose in high doses very rarely cuz its rly intense and takes to recover or sober up or stop. 
i kinda have a super philosophical brain, i believe in God (im muslim) 

man idk what im doing with my life is there any way how to have a good real life or is it all distractions from reality (if it is, then i still wont prolly kms, just idk i can be alone and pleased/satisfied with my life alone no nothing just me doing nothing all day besides laying down in my bed and thinking all day. i dont need anything but basic needs
like a super isolation for years i would survive, but i wouldnt do it for no reward, or i even wouldnt do it for a reward for the fsmily and i gotta pray five times a day, anyways i cant seem to find a question to ask maybe idk

I've had depression for most of my life. Almost ended it all at 13. Ever since then, I've felt empty. Like I am just a shell of a human.

I finished school at 16...I think. I can't even remember for sure anymore. I lost the few friends I had, since I usually just saw them at school. I never got a higher education. Nothing interested me. So I stayed home, spending my time on video games or watching videos, and of course, sleeping a lot. Now, I've lived like this for 7 years. I have really bad social anxiety, and even the thought of going in the public makes me uncomfortable. We'll see if I have the guts to even post this.

I feel trapped. I feel like things will never get better.

I feel lonely. I haven't had a real friend in so long. I tried making some friends online, but I ended up pushing them away. I felt like they deserved better than me. I feel like I am not good enough for anyone. But at the same time, I yearn for a deep connection with someone.

My parents know I am depressed. They get angry when I talk about my depression, so I don't talk about my feelings to them anymore.

I'm basically not even alive, with the way my life is right now. Nothing ever happens, the next day is a copy of the day before. I am sick of it.

1j5brrw,1741310525.0,"I’m 19, my birthday is coming up soon, and I’ve been in the same situation for about 6-7 years. no friends, no social life.. blah blah blah…

Not having these things are what gave me depression, and now depression is what’s stoping me from getting these things. 

Now.. the issue is that I’m not diagnosed, so I can’t get any treatment.

I also don’t have my license, and there’s nobody I can get to take me (no friends, remember?)… other than my parents. 

My parents are great, nothing wrong with them, they would 100% understand. But I genuinely don’t know how to approach this. For literal years, I’ve gone over how I could tell them that I’m depressed, and that I need help. And for some silly reason, I start to tear up, just thinking about it.

I’m not necessarily afraid of them seeing me cry, but I really don’t think I could handle breaking down in front of my parents, about how depressed I am, and how much I’ve been suffering for all these years. It almost seems like it’s just.. a lot of bottled up emotion? I mean, I’ve never told anyone how I feel. And like.. I can’t even think about telling anyone without tearing up.

(The thing I fear the most is that they’ll feel really bad for me, and treat me differently. I don’t want to be seen as a poor, sad, little boy. Even if that’s kind of what I am right now lmao)

One thing is for sure, though. I can’t keep living like this. My depression is at an all time high, and it’s getting worse every day. My parents know something is wrong now, my room is… insanely messy (huge understatement), my hygiene is at its worst, and I feel like doing nothing.

I know they think I’m just lazy, because they keep asking me why I don’t clean my room, why I don’t clean up after myself, why I don’t come out of my room, why I don’t talk anymore.. my dad just asked me if he’s doing something wrong, (on the phone) and it just made me tear up. I’m making their life harder, too, at this point.

So! I’d like advice, or somthing. I don’t really know. I feel pretty silly about this, I think it’s kind of dumb.

1j5biaz,1741309746.0,"Yeah. I’m at a breaking point or something. I saw someone yesterday who just commented telling me that they saw me and I looked like I was just done. And they on top of my mom and anyone who reads these post are worried. And honestly. Now I’m even more worried with that on top of my thoughts. I knew I was bad but I didn’t realize I that bad that it was showing. No one really told me. And sure I feel it but I guess I didn’t realize how much it was showing. 

I can’t help but slightly wonder if I’ll even make it to spring break. I’m getting to a point where death sounds better than waiting this treacherous wait. I’m not suicidal. But I guess some part of me doesn’t want to be alive. I can’t bring myself to do math homework. And I can’t even bring myself to eat tn. 

I called the guy I like and he told me it had been a long week which kinda made me sad cause I could tell he was tired and I was hoping to talk to him. I’m also just slightly annoyed cause he has no idea how bad I’m getting. And it’s a good thing he doesn’t. But it just made me slightly annoyed. He’s lucky he doesn’t have anything but homework tomorrow. I’m super jealous. 

I feel super disoriented. I only got two hours of sleep last night. And I just found out I’m losing an hour of sleep this weekend which really sucks cause I need sleep. 

I don’t even think I can type anymore. This all feel jumbled and wrong. 

I’m crashing so hard and I’m wondering how much harder I’ll crash. Will I even survive this? I don’t know. And i dont want to care. But at the same time i really am done. 

I wish my school took mental health days cause im need of desperately. Or I just need a phone call with the guy I like or mom. But both didn’t really seem to want to talk. So that’s not helping.

1j5a5qm,1741305801.0,"Quick phone post before I head out.

Last year, I was doing a premed program in Western U that I worked really hard to get into, and had a near two year relationship going. I had a scholarship, my mom's small business was doing great (I didn't have to work hahahaha), and I think the summer before I went on a cruise to Alaska where I saw humpback whales for the first time. I also had my first amateur boxing competition in Niagara, which was really cool and something I always wanted to do (my record so far is 0-2). I had some pretty bad anxiety through high school, but I remember thinking to myself, yeah you got over that shit! Good job! It's been tough but you're fucking winning you daft bastard! If you've ever thought to yourself ""hey, what does life without mental illness feel like"", this is pretty much it. 

Few months later I got kicked out of my super competitive program due to a failed chem class, then got put on probation for failing calc, then completely fucked it and got kicked out of university for a horrendous final semester where I think my GPA turned into a 1.3. I thought to myself, ok! You know what, i'm not the type of guy to just give up and sit there and cry myself a puddle. I'm a winner! I got this shit! I'll focus on my relationship and reapply and go to community college in the winter. 

For some reason, I just didn't apply. 

I don't know what it was, but I just couldn't bring myself to apply to college. I kept telling myself ""I missed the February deadline I can't apply anymore"" or ""none of these courses are related to my program"" and I just ended up doing nothing. I think, the same thing happened with my relationship. I really, really wanted to tell her that I needed her help and I wanted to call her every day and hang out with her and ask how she was doing... but I didn't do any of that. I just ignored her or told her I was doing great, and I could feel how concerned she was but I didn't want to bring up anything. I don't know why! I think I did actually get over that after a while, but at that point I could feel how distant she was. Went on a date to the AGO when I was home, then argued, and I was back in London (London ontario) again. Told her over the phone that we should break up, and she agreed and that was it. 

Ok! That's fine! I'll just focus on my passions. Maybe I'll do some volunteering at the hospice or my local hospital and write a book or some shit. I'll watch more movies and work out and pick up the piano and go boxing again! Someday we'll put all of this behind us. Can't do anything. I sat in bed for 2 months, in my apartment. Didn't go home again either because I didn't tell my mom I was kicked out and I didn't want to go back. Seeing her smile at me and ask about how school was going felt like driving a fucking serrated knife into my heart. Lying about it felt like banging my head against a desk.

I got denied a hospital volunteering position, joined the reserve, then started waiting tables at fucking Jack Astors of all places to keep up with rent. Except holy shit I felt like I wasn't doing anything at all! I mean, I wasn't progressing my education, or my career, or my passions, or my relationship which I didn't have anymore. I feel so completely unresponsive to anything that's supposed to help me get out of this hole. I didn't even bother to get help or get diagnosed with anything this entire time!

THE FUNNIEST SHIT IS, I can't even bring myself to play video games or fucking jerk off anymore. It's just one thing after another and each time it's like my head hitting the mat and hearing the ref count to 10 as I debate with myself if I should get up and get beat up again! NO, I DON'T WANT TO GET BEAT UP AGAIN! I want to turn back time to a year ago where I felt comfortable at home, where I had a girlfriend that I promised to fucking marry, when I had DIRECTION for a CAREER. FUCK! I'm not the type of guy to just give up and sit there and cry cuz that shit does nothing! But that's what I'm doing right now, and I can't even cry anymore! What the fuck is going on!!!!!!!!

I hate my roommates that I used to like, I can't talk to girls anymore??? I got skinny as fuck, then started getting fat from all the fucking Jack ASStors food. Stopped boxing, stopped working out, stopped learning shit, stopped crying. I think I just stopped caring. I remember my high school English teacher telling me about how I shouldn't be using ""I"" to start my sentences all the time, but fuck who cares.

1j59s56,1741304749.0,"I’m a failure..

I fuck up everything good in my life. I had the most amazing guy and I fucked it up. 

I’m a miserable, depressed piece of shit. With no self esteem and severe social anxiety. 

My life sucks. I ruin everything for everyone including myself. I drain the happiness and fun out of everything. I don’t know how to laugh, be myself or make jokes anymore. 

I take several medications. Nothing helps anymore.

I had multiple shots at my dream job and I fucked every last one of them up. 

I’m 25 with no future and no friends. All of my college friends moved away and forgot about me. I don’t have any friends. The only time I get a text message is when my medications are ready. 

I’m stuck at home being a caregiver for my sick mother. Who sometimes still controls me like a child. I have too much guilt to leave her behind and go else where. 

I have no money, no license (bc I’m too much of a pussy to get behind the wheel), no car. Nothing. 

I’m not a normal girl. I hate dress clothes, don’t want children, no make up. Only video games, superheros and having a potty mouth worse than a sailor. I’m clingy, rude, no social skills, and can be loud. Who would like that? Even my own fucking dog hates my guts.

1j594zv,1741302972.0,"Dear all,

I hope it is okay to  post something like this here. If not, please let me know where and how I do this correctly.

A friend of my girlfriend  is struggling with depression. I don't really know this friend, except meeting her twice or so. 
A few months ago, she reached out to my girlfriend and some other friends. She says she has been extremely lonely. She has fun social activities, but all interactions are superficial and don't really lead to real friendships. Ever since, she has occasionally (a few times per week) slept at either one of the places of those friends. 

She has slept at our place for two nights now when I was also in. Yesterday was the first time I talked to her about her situation. To me, it sounds very much like serious depression. She also called it depression herself.
Tonight was the first time I have seen her when she was in a panic attack. Shaking, crying, hyperventilating. We tried to be very gentle, walk a bit with her, try to let her breathe more gently. At the end she was still crying a bit but her breathing was normal and she could talk. She told us she was very afraid of going to bed due to her nightmares. 

My first question would, what is a way in which we could help her? She seems out of her panic attack for now, but what could we do on the middle to long term? Right now she's occasionally sleeping at friends places for company and support, but this is very draining for these friends, mentally. From what she had told me, her parents are extremely unsupportive, telling her in the morning that she should be quite during the night, even though she's having a full blown panic attack. 

My second question requires a bit of background 

The situation in the Netherlands is that for regular psychologists/psychiatrists that are covered through health insurance, waiting lists are very long, well over a year sometimes. So I've been thinking of trying ""commercial"" psychaitrists. I could use some savings, some friends could, and maybe we could reach out the her parents. Does anyone have experience with this, advice on what we should try and avoid? I know someone has offered something like this to her on the past and she refused, so I would also like some takes on what to do when someone refuses help.

Again if I should ask this question somewhere else, do let me know. We would like advice from people with experience before ee make any uneducated discussions.",1,1,0,dear hope okay post something like please let know correctly friend girlfriend struggling depression dont really know friend except meeting twice months ago reached girlfriend friends says extremely lonely fun social activities interactions superficial dont really lead real friendships ever since occasionally times per week slept either one places friends slept place two nights also yesterday first time talked situation sounds much like serious depression also called depression tonight first time seen panic attack shaking crying hyperventilating tried gentle walk bit try let breathe gently end still crying bit breathing normal could talk told us afraid going bed due nightmares first question would way could help seems panic attack could middle long term right shes occasionally sleeping friends places company support draining friends mentally told parents extremely unsupportive telling morning quite night even though shes full blown panic attack second question requires bit background situation netherlands regular psychologistspsychiatrists covered health insurance waiting lists long well year sometimes ive thinking trying commercial psychaitrists could use savings friends could maybe could reach parents anyone experience advice try avoid know someone offered something like past refused would also like takes someone refuses help ask question somewhere else let know would like advice people experience ee make uneducated discussions
1j4ovza,1741240844.0,"This is going to be a long one. I just...need to vent I suppose. I've only been *this* depressed twice before in my life.  There's kinda always been some background low level depression, but man, I forgot how bad it can get.

I only have a small handful of friends, and they're all busy with their lives and can't really make time for me. My best friend of nearly 20 years and I fell out around 2 years ago, and I don't think the relationship will ever be fixable.  My other close friends all have their own little families or committed relationships now that are their priority, so I only really get to talk to them or spend time with them a couple times a year at most.  My online friends are all busy with their current game obsessions, and don't want to switch to something that I can play with them to take my mind off things.  I've no energy or desire to do any of my solo hobbies.

My gf of 9 months is talking to me less and less, saying she's worried I'll develop an ""unhealthy attachment"" and ""codependency"".  It's making me feel so... worthless, ignored and unloved.  I just want to feel important to someone... and that she can't be that person, that she doesn't want to be that person, is absolutely crushing.  I knew things with her would never get truly serious, since she's solo poly, but fuck man... she won't even spare me 15 *total minutes* out of her day most of the time at this point.  We used to talk all the time, but it feels like I'm just getting breadcrumbed at this point and given excuses to justify it... She'll message me maybe 1-3 times most days now. ""Hey, hru?"", ""I'm ok/My day is ok"", and ""Sorry, busy with work/parenting/other people"" is the gist of what I get.  So, I turn to social media to kill time, and she's popping up in my feeds.  She'll be actively posting and commenting on social media, interacting with other people, and commenting about talking to and spending time with other people.  While I get ignored and left on read most of the day.  We only get to see each other like once a month now.  Even when we spend time together in-person, she's still on her phone using social media and texting other people frequently.  Hell, it was my birthday last week and she forgot to tell me happy birthday til 3 days later when I called her to talk for a couple minutes (tbh, none of my friends actually remembered it was my birthday, either.  Just family members, and even then I know my mom sends out reminder texts).  Granted my gf and I live about an hour away from each other now, but still, it feels like I'm asking for some monumental thing just wanting a little bit more attention and care.  Like it's too much to just talk like we used to.  I'm simplifying some things about the relationship, but still... am I really *that much* of a chore and inconvenience?  Am I really asking too much to just want to talk during some of their downtime, and be in the loop?  Is it *that big of a problem* just wanting to feel like they actually want to include me in their day, wanting to feel like they actually want me around and want to talk to me?  She says she's trying to fit me into her life, but I'm having a really hard time feeling like a priority and feeling valued.  

And, being in this poly situationship, I'm actively trying to find other people to talk to on dating apps, but I hardly get any matches.  And of the people that do match, only a few of them actually respond to messages.  And even if the conversation goes great and there's *explicitly expressed interest from both of us* in meeting, they ghost as soon as we start trying to make plans every time.  I've even met a couple people in-person at social events, hit it off with them and got their info to chat more, and *still get ghosted* once we start making plans to go out.  It's fucking exhausting and devastating to feel like nobody wants me at any level.  I keep the conversations lighthearted and engaging, but I just keep getting shown that none of these people I'm trying to connect with actually want to really connect with me. My sense of self-worth and self-esteem has never been lower.  I'm honestly not sure which I felt lonelier during, when I had no relationship or prospects, having prospects that keep ghosting me, or having a relationship that makes me feel alone.  I voiced my dating frustrations to a friend of mine a couple weeks ago, and they told me to keep trying because I'm worthy of and deserve the love and attention I want, and I damn near started sobbing right then and there.

I also have chronic migraines, not having had a single day pain-free in \~4 years now.  Four different neurology specialists, a handful of other specialists, and a long list of failed medications and treatments later and there's still no answers for why this is happening and no end in sight.    Multiple MRI's, CT scans, x-rays, blood tests, allergy tests, breathing and sleep tests, chiropractic/massage/acupuncture sessions, hell even a fucking lumbar puncture (with complications that the performing doctor didn't believe me about until my neurologist talked to them *5 days later*).  Literally all the tests and imaging came back normal.  Shit, I even paid in the ballpark of $1200 out of pocket for some specialized glasses (that insurance refused to cover) because it was recommended to me by someone else with migraines and it's shown to be effective for *some people*, but in the end they only slightly improved the migraines for about 3-4 months before they were back to normal.  And what really sucks is the migraines have been slowly getting worse each year.  They're worse now than they've ever been before.  And they're not behaving the same as they did at the start, so my current neurologist is frustrated and confused because I can't give them any consistent straight answers to any of their questions about it.  ""Yeah, I mean, it's behaving this way *now*, but 6 months ago it wasn't this way.  There *were* other symptoms that were more common a year ago, but hardly happen now.  Which is all different than how it was when it started 4 years ago.""  It's beyond draining to be in this much pain this regularly and have absolutely nothing to show for it all but medical bills.

And to top all this off, I got laid off at the end of last year, have no new job or job prospects, and due to the depression, chronic pain, and also unmedicated ADHD, I haven't been able to find a new job or work on certification courses to find a better one.  I'm just surviving off of my savings.  Between the mental health and chronic pain, I don't even have the energy to crawl out of my bed before 3-4 in the afternoon rolls around.  Get up, get a little food in me, sit at my computer and do nothing for a couple hours, then I'm back in bed for the night.  I'm out of bed for a grand total of 2-5 hours, and not able to do hardly anything the whole time.  So being essentially useless is even more depressing.

FML.  Feels like rock bottom, but damn if it doesn't look like there's a basement that'll keep going.  Honestly, it'd all be so much more bearable if even one of the people I'm closest to could spare the time and energy for me.  But, at the same time, it's so hard to actually open up and talk to anyone about what I'm going through and just how bad it is.  And at this point, I'm in deep enough that being shown love and care from anyone else would just make me feel even more pitiful, and that that love and care would be superficial at best.

I'm trying to find professional help with what little energy I do get during the week, but all I've been getting is waitlists and answering machines.

Anyway, I'm done venting. Might delete this all later, idk. Gonna just...keep trying to make it through, one day at a time.

1j58czh,1741300924.0,"I would first like to tell what got me worrying about this to give you a better idea before I get into the main part of this so please bear with me. 

Lately, something has been bothering me a lot. I think about it almost everyday. What if someday I lose my purpose of living? 

Let me begin by when it first started. I was on the marriage sub and I saw this post about a man whose wife cheated on him with his close friend, he was devasted, betrayed by two people and people who knew about it kept it from him, his kids had started to lean more towards their mother's lover because he was also their football coach and they weren't filled on the details given their young age.

The man has a series of posts on his profile, the first one was a little more than an year ago, and all the way to just a few days back. According to him, he had started to work out, at healthy, focus on himself but up until his latest post, he's still not okay...

The man was in his 40s and had been married to his wife for the past 15 years, while his wife met her lover just 4 months before the man found out about it. According to him, the dating pool for 40+ man isn't as wide and he doesn't feel like dating anymore as he had always thought that he would grow old with his wife and that he will have a hard time trusting someone anyway.

I kept thinking about it, the way the man is still all alone and as a 20 year old, who's not in a relationship nor is seeking, it just stressed me out a lot, this fear of being cheated on? was it that? but why? I can't even relate with him since I've never been in a relationship let alone being cheated on. I tried to sort my thoughts and I realized that it wasn't exactly just the fear of being cheated on, but also the fact that if that happens, I would lose the purpose of my life.

This is similar to how some people are afraid of death. I feel like this is the type of fear I'm having, I'm not even afraid of death but somehow this is making me feek depressed me.

I realized that it's not exactly the fear of being cheated on, but more so a fear that what would life be like if I end up loving someone so much that I make them my reason for waking up everyday, make her the most important person in my life, more than my passion and work, my reason for living.

How would I cope with it if they end up betraying me? 

This is the main thing bothering me, the main reason why I could relate with the man in the story so bad despite not ever being in a relationship myself is because I know how meaningless life feels sometimes.
I love watching animes, playing games but at the times when I'm depressed over some so small and trivial, I don't feel like engaging in any of my habbits, I can't imagine what the man must've been through and now my brain keeps putting me in his shoes.

I'm worried that if something like that happens to me, all my hobbies, all the things I do now won't feel fun to me if something like that happens and at that time if I'm an older person, I won't even be able to find someone else and if I did, it would never be the same. I would lose my purpose of living and the ""What ifs"" are killing me.

One of the worst parts about this is that I'm losing faith in this relationship. I'm a 20 yr old guy who has never been in a relationship before and isn't in one currently, so the whole concept of love is being damaged for me, before it even occured to me. 

I'm having seconds thoughts about putting everything aside for my future partner because if I don't that, if I make my other purposes, other goals have more value, be more focused on them then I won't feel as if life is meaningless if something like that were to happen to me, I would still have a reason to wake up for.
But I know, that I will always end up putting her first so I don't think that would work.

This weird fear made feel anxious, and I end up reading more into it, more stories on reddit, stumbled upon r /adultery (god I wish I hadn't) 

This has been going on for weeks. Sometimes I feel fine but at night times I think about it again, imagining myself in scenerios or just dive too deep into the stories of people who had suffered from something like that and start to feel their pain and then get angry on myself over it all.

This relationship is something I've always believed to be really strong, because of some of the stories I've heard a long time ago, of people being so in love that they were willing to sacrifice themselves for their significant other but after reading so many stories of people betraying after decades of marriage like the story I mentioned, I just don't know what to think anymore... If I lived with someone in the same house, without anything else, I would develop such a strong attachment to them by just being their room mate, I'm just that type of person, then how is it possible for people to leave after decades of being together?

I don't know how to recover from this, I also feel angry on myself that I keep thinking about this. How do I stop this and change the way I think? or should I just accept my view the way it is... 

I'm just afraid of losing my purpose in life.

Sorry for the long post, thanks for reading if you did ❤️

I no longer have a meaning to suffer I have no point for this shit living is unbearable, every second and every heartbeat feels painful, the only moments I dont want to die is when Im distracted with video games or YouTube videos. 

But then what, tomorrow I have 3 exams and I didnt study for any of them, because I cant go one second without being distracted that I'll start getting suicidal, its my last year of high school, im supposed to be studying hours a day to get into college, if I want a good future i need to work this year, I know it but so what? I dont want a future, no matter how successful I can become I'll still be in pain, I will always work a job I dont care for just to pay bills for purchases I dont care for. Whats the point? I no longer have one, theres no finishing line and the path isnt good enough to justify the pain.

 I always get told that I should be grateful that I'm not as miserable as other people and I never understood that, there are people who suffer more than me and I'm meant to be happy about it? Am I weird for refusing to accept any positive emotions that come from the information that other people are miserable? Knowing how much this world sucks only makes me want to not live in it Im not glad or grateful that I didnt have the worst life as much as I feel horrible to know someone else did.  I feel alone, like no one can understand me, no matter bow much pain people around me have they never consider suicide, thats just not an option for them, but for me it always has been, I cant go one day without thinking of how much I want to die. Am I crazy? How can other people bare this godforsaken world and accept this shitty reality, how can people live happily knowing about the sufferings of others, knowing that no matter how much you try to help them there will always be things you can't do to help people, knowing that suffering is just a constant in this world and that it nothing of it matters.

 I simply cant take it anymore, people dont need a reason to live they just need a reason to keep suffering, I no longer have a reason, and every time I think about what I lost my body goes numb and I almost collapse, and now all I have is the reality of how ugly it is, and I cant anymore, the pain of loosing the only thing that gave my life joy is unbearable yet I cant cry, I cant stop, I dont have time for that cause I'm meant to be working and studying, and this is making me go insane, I dont have time to cope or care, I only have time to suffer, and when I think about the future I realize that its all for nothing, that the only thing I can guarantee is my own suffering, my own agony, so why oh why should I live? They say there are things so good that make life worth living, but shouldnt the opposite be true as well? Shouldn't there be experiences so vile that justify suicide? If life is a gamble then shouldnt i be allowed to not participate? I may avoid all the good things of my future but the idea I'll also avoid the pain seems worth it. Because right now every second is torturing.

I really might just do it this time",2,0,0,sorry cringe rambling im done man ive enough ask whats point suffering people say make meaning life really make meaning life lost thing longer brings joy brings pain hatred world longer meaning suffer point shit living unbearable every second every heartbeat feels painful moments dont want die im distracted video games youtube videos tomorrow exams didnt study cant go one second without distracted ill start getting suicidal last year high school im supposed studying hours day get college want good future need work year know dont want future matter successful become ill still pain always work job dont care pay bills purchases dont care whats point longer one theres finishing line path isnt good enough justify pain always get told grateful im miserable people never understood people suffer im meant happy weird refusing accept positive emotions come information people miserable knowing much world sucks makes want live im glad grateful didnt worst life much feel horrible know someone else feel alone like one understand matter bow much pain people around never consider suicide thats option always cant go one day without thinking much want die crazy people bare godforsaken world accept shitty reality people live happily knowing sufferings others knowing matter much try help always things cant help people knowing suffering constant world nothing matters simply cant take anymore people dont need reason live need reason keep suffering longer reason every time think lost body goes numb almost collapse reality ugly cant anymore pain loosing thing gave life joy unbearable yet cant cry cant stop dont time cause im meant working studying making go insane dont time cope care time suffer think future realize nothing thing guarantee suffering agony oh live say things good make life worth living shouldnt opposite true well shouldnt experiences vile justify suicide life gamble shouldnt allowed participate may avoid good things future idea ill also avoid pain seems worth right every second torturing really might time
1j54kql,1741291302.0,"I’m a very curious person and went down a rabbit whole about 2 weeks ago. After reading so many articles, Reddit posts,  and quora posts, I’ve been left with only anxiety and worries. Like I don’t feel like there’s a purpose for anything I do. I’ve deleted social media to eliminate seeing news about deaths because whenever I see a story of someone who tragically passed away, I start getting paranoid and anxious for my family and I. Even when I’m out with my family, waves of anxiety and hopelessness wash over me and I just end up tuning everything out around me. I’ve told my family about it but they’ve only told me “just try not to thinking about it”. But the thoughts are obsessive. It’s like my mind is purposefully trying to sabotage me once I finally feel happy or in a better mood. I only see my therapist once a month now, so there’s not a constant stream of help that I can get.

1j54aon,1741290596.0,"Currently going through a depressive episode (it's been ongoing for a while now). Depression isn't new for me, but it comes in waves, and some are easier to go through than others. With everything going on, it's harder than normal for me to escape feelings of despair, especially with my growing anxiety about the future. But I don't want to talk about that; I really don't want all of these feelings to consume me until it's literally all that I think about. I've been listening to music more as a way to help me cope with everything, as I've found it to be the most effective thing to help me (and honestly, the only thing that's helped me sometimes). 

To those who also listen to music, what are some songs or artists that you've found to be comforting/soothing? My go-to artist is Sufjan Stevens (currently listening to his cover of ""The Lakes of Canada"" and just listened to some of his instrumental stuff), who's among my favorite artists in general, though I've also been listening to Young the Giant, Cigarettes After Sex, and Hayley Williams (her solo project, rather than Paramore) lately too. As far as recs go, I'm open to vocal and instrumental stuff.

1j53rg3,1741289226.0,"I am currently back on my weight loss journey. I’ve spent my entire adult life trying to get to the best version of myself. 
At my heaviest, I’ve been 400lbs, and gotten to my lightest at 259lbs 3 years ago. Then I got in a relationship with the woman whom I love to this day. But three years together, I’ve gained so much weight, getting myself back to 370lbs. I never felt so low about myself. I got back on the saddle in January and started to move more and eat less and fast with a 17:8 hour window. Only thing I restrict myself of is sugar (sometimes) and sometimes bread, and gone down to 345lbs. It’s a no brainer that I tend to indulge when my day is batshit stressful due to work

I work as an Instructional Assistant, with violent emotionally/mentally disturbed teenagers. I particularly work one on one with a student that’s violent, non Verbal, with severe autism. He has violent episodes where he attacks me 3/4 times a day, resulting in hitting, biting and scratching. And I do feel like he is a great kid but I’ve def binged eat a time here and there when the day was just HARD. Food has been my escape since I was a child, relating to trauma I experienced (I am noting that 4/5 years ago I’ve had two different therapists that somewhat helped) but the food noise on those worst days win over me. When this does happen, I try not to beat myself for it, because I recognize that I am proud I am not using food to escape everyday and then I continue with my fast cuz I don’t eat past 7pm. 

Another thing that adds to my Depression is my low self esteem, not having genuine friends and the ppl I’ve considered friends, I’ve noticed don’t involve me in group photos in social settings like they did when I was 259lbs. Really hard to maintain friendships when I don’t feel good about myself. Aside from my partner, I’ve always spent a lot of time by myself and have always felt lonely.

1j53o5z,1741289000.0,"I'm 23F and my boyfriend is 24.

We've been together almost a year and it's gotten to a point where I can barely remember his happiness or personality. He lives with his family. I live alone and he's declined to live with me multiple times out of fear of losing his family support. (His family is very conditional from what I can tell.)

Here are some of the behaviors that lead me to think he's depressed;



* he says ""I'm mad at the world, not you""
* hes always tired
* hates his job & hobbies he used to enjoy
* doesnt go to school
* isolates/distant
* more upset than happy in life overall
* forgets plans, doesn't look forward to anything
* cries randomly 
* irritable
* doesn't do self care, basic needs
* body pains
* lots of negative talk
* feels like he lets me/ his family down

  
For a while, I've expressed my desire for him to check on me. I felt like my bare minimum was his maximum effort, and I felt alone in the relationship. He's made efforts to improve consistently, but he's easily triggered by any disappointment I have or life disturbances of his, then he starts stonewalling or becoming irritable. He disappears some days, once or twice a week. Usually, he's isolating or draining himself with work or helping friends. When he was younger, he was baker-acted but I haven't been necessarily worried about him doing something extreme. We've broken up multiple times because he feels like he can't meet my needs. He calls himself a loser. He says ""I feel like shit"". And he's constantly self-loathing. I know I love him, but I can't see what I love about him anymore, I'm hoping that's temporary.

1j53hlr,1741288544.0,"Hi,

So I have been writing lately, I also added parts/point to my Doctor to better understand me and respond to my requests, I know it is long, but it is a series of writing throughout the past 6 months. 

I just wanted to share it... Maybe one day in the future, people will read my story xD

\---

**Personal Mental Health/Depression History \*****^(Public)**

**Childhood and Early Life (Up to Age 12)**

I had a **normal childhood** until age 12, but in **fifth grade**, I developed a **fear of school** due to teachers **physically punishing students** who didn’t complete their homework. This fear lasted until my mother intervened, and I was able to return to school normally.

I struggled in school, excelling only in memorization, but even that was difficult. My mind constantly wandered, making it hard to keep up.

Outside of school, I saw my grandmother having what I now believe was a seizure, but as a child, I didn’t realize what was happening and walked away. Minutes later, I heard the maid scream, “She’s not moving!” My father tried to wake her, but she never did, and later the **Paramedics** came. She passed away at the hospital. That moment left me with **deep guilt and became my first experience with trauma**.

**Onset of Depression (Ages 13-14) (Episode Zero - The Sad Face)**

At **13-14 years old**, I experienced my **first episode of depression**. I felt **sad every day at school**, and things worsened when my **older brother switched to home-schooling**, leaving me to attend alone. My **father suggested I switch as well**, which I did, hoping it would help.

During this time, I **withdrew socially**, stayed home, and **avoided friends**. My family noticed my sadness, and it became part of my expression—**the ""sad face"" I have**. I also had **persistent negative thoughts**, but I couldn’t understand or explain them. Later, my brother and I switched to **private night schooling** to improve our grades.

**Temporary Improvement and Adolescence (Ages 15-19)**

At age 15, during a trip with relatives and friends my age, the sadness suddenly lifted, and I felt normal again. My family noticed the positive change (I thought my sadness of the previous 2 years was due to growing up). However, between the ages of 16-19 when I switched to normal schooling, I started experiencing alternating phases of:

1. **Depressive episodes** with sadness and social withdrawal (Sometimes social fear).
2. **Periods of high productivity and motivation,** during which I was socially active, and I would learn new things (e.g., programming) but stop after a few weeks, often feeling drained or losing interest.
3. I was **still bad** at **school**, I only passed with high grades because it was a private school and I used to not attend school, only few days a month!**…**

The cycles of depression were unpredictable and left me feeling emotionally unstable. During this time, my main **coping mechanism** was playing **video games** or watching **TV shows.** These activities helped distract me and provided temporary relief but weren’t effective later during my *major* depressive episodes, particularly during intense ones.

**Post-High School Challenges (Ages 19-24)**

1. After graduating high school, I spent **one year at home** due to not being accepted into university because my grades in the entry exams were low, which caused frustration and sadness. 
2. When I finally joined university, majoring in English, which was my interest since I was young, and the only subject I am good at. My **first year** was exciting; I was actively involved in group projects and studies, and made new friends and was socially active where I go with them every day. I was also getting A’s because I was telling myself if I don’t do so, I’ll be a failure all my life, which gave me a high motivation, but really a stressful night of studying.
3. In my **second year,** I started isolating myself socially, interacting with peers & friends only when necessary. This isolation continued throughout university years.
4. My **final year** was marked by depression, shared among many peers, driven by fears of an uncertain future. After graduating, I spent **eight months at home job-searching** and battling depression.

**First Job and Transition to a Toxic Role (Age 24)**

**First Job: Excitement and Growth**

Eight months after graduating, I got my first and best job as a Customer Service Associate at Amazon. It was fulfilling, and I felt excited to build my career. I connected well with my colleagues who were also new to the job, and I started settling into the work environment and made new friends that I would call best friends and was telling my self I am finally going to settle but it didn’t last.

After two months, I got **higher-paying job offers, including one in the military. It was a stressful decision, but I left.**

**Toxic Job: Hospital Role**

I decided to leave my first job for a civilian position at a well-known hospital *temporarily* as I wait for final confirmation at a different job. Initially I was expected to work in **ER reception** but was instead assigned a **physically demanding supply role**. My **transfer requests were denied**, and the job became **too exhausting**, leading me to resign without another job lined up.

**Major Panic/Depressive Episodes 2023/2024**

**First Episode (Toxic Job – Early 2023, Age 24)**                                                          

This occurred during my time at the toxic job in early 2023. The physically demanding nature of the role, a toxic environment, combined with feelings of being trapped in a position I didn’t sign up for, caused severe exhaustion and mental strain. I felt overwhelmed, helpless, and unmotivated. I struggled to advocate for myself when my requests for a transfer to my actual role were denied. This inability to speak up left me feeling even more powerless, amplifying my distress. This depressive episode **marked** my **first experience** with **intense feelings of sadness**, **disappointments,** and **despair**. My only way of coping was voice-recording as I drove home each night, where I used to vent out about my issues.

**Relief and Relapse After Toxic Job**

After quitting, I felt euphoric for two months—enjoying freedom, hobbies, and learning. But soon, fear of the future returned, leading to a relapse.

**Second Episode (Uncle's Betrayal –  March/April 2023, Age 24)**

This episode began a couple of months after leaving the toxic hospital job, in the lead-up to **April 2023**. It was triggered by my **uncle's betrayal**, where I helped him by loaning him a rented car in good faith under my name, to which he later refused to return it. He repeatedly lied about returning the car, delayed addressing the fines he accrued, and ignored my requests. The combination of **betrayal**, **financial stress**, and **preparing for my upcoming job** with medical tests by trying to lose weight, caused me to experience one of the **worst depressive episodes of my life**. It lasted for two months with severe sadness (leading to crying for the first time in a decade) and feelings of severe hopelessness.

**Third Episode (New beginning & Department Transfer – May to December 2023, Age 25)**

I was able to get the car back from my uncle and at the same time I started my current job at the University, which was in **May 2023,** feeling relieved, excited, and motivated. For the 1^(st) three months, I worked with full energy and was actively engaged in my role. My efforts were noticed, and I felt a sense of purpose and accomplishment, and thought things were getting **settled** in my life. **However**, as time passed, I began to feel drained. My energy levels dropped, and my colleagues started pointing out that I looked exhausted and needed to take time off or take better care of myself.

In **November 2023,** and with me being drained, I was unexpectedly **told to temporarily transfer** to another department due to staff shortages. Although I felt the transfer was **unfair and beyond my capacity**, I couldn’t bring myself to object (say no) or discuss my concerns with my manager. The new role required me to work alone in a **highly stressful environment** with little support or training. The *sudden change* and *increased pressure* **triggered** a **panic attack**—though I didn’t recognize it as such at the time. I also began experiencing **severe anxiety** and for the first time in my life I had **wishes of death, imagining myself being dead** or even **choking myself for relief**.

Luckily for the first time, I sought help at the ***employee clinic*** around **December 2023**, I was asked so many questions and one of them was if my depression and stress were related to work. At that moment, I didn’t connect the two and said no, not realizing the link because I wanted fast help. This depressive episode lasted about **one month,** in which it prompted me to go to the clinic and start medication for the first time, leading to a series of medications.                              

**Fourth / Later Episode (Promotion Delay – November 2024, Age 26)**            

The fourth episode occurred **briefly** in **November 2024** when I was **promised** a promotion, only to have it delayed unexpectedly. Although it was a **shorter depressive episode**, lasting only about **one week**, I felt deeply **disappointed**, **frustrated**, and **hopeless**. I wanted to **express my dissatisfaction** to my manager but felt overwhelmed by the idea, which **stopped me from speaking up**. Being on medication at the time helped reduce the severity of the symptoms and accepting it as is, but it **led to losing purpose** in **career** and **life**! >>> I was able to speak to him in December 2024 about my disappointment of the delay, which relieved me a bit.

**Key Observations and Patterns**

**Age 27, Male**

**Family History:**

My **father** has **bipolar disorder (I have his report file with medications),** also one of my uncles has **psychosis.** I was told by my father that these conditions and mental conditions ranging from bipolar, psychosis, and adhd are **common** in **our family branch**. I was recently told that even my grandfather had bipolar, which explains a lot. Also, my father is pointing out that some of my brothers have symptoms.

1. **Mood Cycles:**
   * I alternate between:
      * **Depressive phases:** Sadness, social withdrawal, lack of motivation, and ~~suicidal ideation~~.
      * **Periods of energy (rare) & motivation:** Social confidence, high productivity (learning new things & starting new projects), and **impulsiveness** which is noticed after using Wellbutrin.
2. **Triggers:**
   * Stressful life events (e.g., toxic jobs, betrayals) often precede depressive episodes. (sometimes random)
   * All my major depressive episodes were caused by a reason, and all were in the year 2023, but before that, when I was 13-14, my depression came out of nowhere and I consider it a major one.
3. **Physical Symptoms:**
   * **Sleep issues** like oversleeping during depression / reduced sleep or staying up late during high-energy phases \[maybe personality trait or bad habit?\].
   * **Physical agitation:** (e.g., leg shaking, hand tremors and maybe Myoclonus?) It is linked to **Wellbutrin** because after reducing the dose it went away and then increasing the dose it came back.
   * **Forgetfulness:** It started after the new medications for mood stabilization.

**4.      Coping Mechanisms:**

o   *In the* ***past****, I* ***coped*** *with overwhelming emotions by* ***sleeping****,* ***playing video games****,* ***watching shows, and*** ***eating large meals (****led to overweight****)****. These provided temporary distraction but didn’t address the core of my struggles.*

o   *Since starting medications, my* ***coping*** ***has shifted****. Now, I find myself beside watching shows, I started* ***reading*** *about depression,* ***writing****, or sometimes unwillingly getting* ***low*** ***sad emotion****, which occasionally provides relief. However, these methods often feel like distractions rather than solutions, and the sadness or pressure in my chest tends to linger or return.*

***5.      Suicidal Phase:***

o   *I need to be honest, at one point when I was taking Prozac 40mg, my emotions were bland and at that time I secretly was suicidal, where I almost overdosed on my medications, I had them right in my hand and something is telling me DO IT! TAKE IT! I was so tempted to take it! Not only that, I was also searching for a peaceful way to die, but each time at the end I stop.*

o   *Currently I am not suicidal but looking back, I ask myself what made me be like that?*

**Medication Journey (Update as of March 2025)**

Diagnosed with Bipolar II by online psychiatrist, although I was told by the hospital it needs an assessment (currently on the waiting list).

·       **Prozac 20mg (Start: December 2023) – Employee Clinic / Resident/Consultation with** a psychiatrist I consulted

When I first started Prozac, it released my locked emotions, where my emotions were filed in a jar trying to escape, and the jar was pressurized from the locked emotions in it. Prozac came and opened the jar, releasing all my emotions, but in return, it didn’t leave any for me to live with, and it made my life bland and empty.

·        **Prozac 40 mg: (Around July 2024?)** Employee Clinic / a psychiatrist I consulted

It briefly relieved my emotions, but after two weeks, it triggered suicidal thoughts. I believe this was due to increased emotional numbness and lack of joy.

·        **Prozac 60 mg (October 2024):** Employee Clinic / Resident with consultation to a psychiatrist I consulted.

It was similar to the effect of 40mg and caused temporary sadness (only 1 week) and afterward emptiness. Currently I am at 20mg.

·       **Wellbutrin (Started Late October 2024) – Prescribed by a Psychiatry Consultant (A) –** 

Wellbutrin gave me the boost I wanted, similar to drinking an energy drink. It made me energized, but I was reckless when I was energized. I made big-time decisions fast. People like to call it a hypomania phase. Although Wellbutrin helped me with my low energy, but what is the point of energy if you have no desire in life? It caused severe side effects. I was told to lower the dose to taper off Wellbutrin, but doing so made my energy and motivation drop significantly. I thought I should at least take 75mg in the morning and 75mg at night, but I don’t think it did much in the long run. I was later unmotivated and had low energy, so I upped the dose based on the recommendation of a psychiatrist. I feel like I’m back to better now.

·       **Quetiapine (Started December 2024) – Prescribed by Psychiatry Consultant (B) –** 

Quetiapine helped me during sleep, but a higher dose was too much for me; it made my mornings sluggish. I started with 25mg before bedtime and increased till 100mg, but it made me extremely tired the next morning. I found that 25-50mg is the best dose for now, and I was told it’s okay to stay on it.

·       **Lamictal 25mg to 300mg (Started December 2024) – Prescribed by Psychiatry Consultant (B) –** 

It made me feel like my normal self again. I feel like Lamictal made my mood more stable but only stable, not higher or better. It was prescribed to stabilize my mood due to concerns about bipolar tendencies. a psychiatrist I consulted later told me to increase weekly by 50mg until I reached 300mg, which is considered the therapeutic dose. I currently take 300mg (2 pills in the morning and 1 at night). I feel like it made me feel back to myself, but gave me forgetfulness of short-term memory, I think.

·       **Aripiprazole (Started January 9, 2025) – Prescribed by a Consultant (C) -** 

Initially prescribed at 5mg after confirmation of Bipolar II tendencies, which overwhelmed me with sadness. I was later told to increase it to 7.5mg and then 10mg, but I stopped after experiencing severe restlessness where I needed to move a lot. It got to a point where I went to the clinic for help, but they didn’t do much. An online psychiatrist later told me to stop the medication. I am currently taking 2.5mg to taper off.

·       **Propranolol 40mg (PRN) – Prescribed to Manage Restlessness and Hand Jitter**

Propranolol helped with the jitteriness caused by Wellbutrin and with something I always used to have, which is a high heart rate. I was told to take it daily to help with the restlessness and hand jittering caused by Wellbutrin.

***Note*** *that I am currently feeling like each medication has helped in certain parts, but some parts aren’t fixed.*

***In short\* Prozac*** *only removed the pressure in my heart I used to have and released my emotions,* ***Wellbutrin*** *helped with energy,* **Quetiapine** helped with sleep, ***Lamictal*** *made my mood more stable,* ***propranolol*** *helped with side effects, for* ***Aripiprazole*** *I don’t know if it helped or not*

**Current Concerns**:

·        Severe restlessness when on Aripiprazole 7.5mg+, to the point it affected me at work since I work in an office. I was told to **stop the medication**, currently at 2.5mg, and **low restlessness.**

·        I **can’t** stay focused on boring tasks; I just stop and lose myself in thoughts. This has always been an issue, even before medications.

·        I lost my ability to pay attention to details

·        I **feel tired** each morning. I think it is because I sometimes stay late.

·        I **feel** like I am **stable**, but sometimes a **sudden mood shift** happens that lasts until the next day, and I can’t understand why. I am also trying to treat my lack of pleasure (**anhedonia**) and to treat severe sudden boredom.

·        I think I am having anxiety in terms of mental health and trying to treat myself out of anxiety.

I am currently also trying to treat other parts of my mental health, **see the following traits that have affected me all my life**, some are more of my personality:

·        In my childhood, I’ve always had trouble staying focused in class or on boring tasks, dealing with boredom, looking for more stimulants like playing, and following through on things. Although I sometimes have this thing where I might look like I am focused or distracted on something, I am actually listening to whatever people are talking about behind me and at the same time looking at the thing I am focused on.

·        I procrastinate a lot where I start things but never finish them. I recently started my second degree in CS, invested money in it, because it was my dream, but later I lost interest and motivation, I later postponed. I also sometimes start projects but lose interest later even though it was exciting at first.

·        I have future and past conversations in my head all the time, and sometimes it gives me a headache. I jump from one thought to another, or sometimes I have too many thoughts at once. This has always been an issue, and I feel like it affected my life, and I am not sure if it is normal or not.

·        I forget things a lot, I put something on a table, and moments later, I don’t remember where I placed it. I was told this isn’t related to Wellbutrin.

·        I have a spending problem, I tend to make fast decisions, sometimes regret them later, but I feel like that’s just my personality.

·        I struggle to stay engaged in anything that isn’t stimulating. Even when I start something important, I later stop because I lose motivation. Although when I have an incentive thing, I stay on it because in my mind it is either I finish whatever is in front of me or things will get worse for me and this how it got me through college, either get A’s or I’ll be a failure the rest of my life which gave anxiety back then.

·        I have this comprehension problem where I write words, my head fills the gap and I jump to the next word, forgetting that I didn’t write the word I was thinking about. Even when reading something I wrote, I see words that aren’t there or forgot to add them. It was much noticeable during my college years.

1j531n7,1741287469.0,"Something that irritates me is when people say ""things will get better, just hang in there and your life will change"". I used to believe that, I used to think they were right, but now? Nope. Things do not get better. Not for me. You know how I know?

I've been depressed since I was 7 years old and started school. It all started with the bullying that kept going for years, the emotional neglect and abuse at home. Then it's the face I've been SA'ed, not once, but three times. Twice was by people I thought I could trust. 

I tried to unalive myself in 2011 and since then my life has only gotten worse in more ways than already mentioned. When I told my counsellor in school (I was 16), she called my mother. Guess what she said? ""What the hell are you doing? What will the family think? You are dishonoring us. How can you do something like this?"" She got mad at me, but of course my counsellor didn't know that because she said it in her native language. She didn't care about why I had tried to do it, nor did she ever once talk to me about it after we left. Comfort was never given. Like it had never even happened. When I got SA'ed the first time, she called me a wh\*\*\* when she found out about the guy. I had never been with anybody before that and I didn't even want what happened to me, and I'm a wh\*\*\*? It hurt. 

Yes, I have tried, I've tried SO HARD to keep going. So hard just to fight through it and make myself happy. Create a better life for myself, but each time something would come and break it all apart. After everything that has happened. After everything that has not only caused chronic depression, GAD and most likely undiagnosed CPTSD/PTSD, and my already day to day struggles of being autistic & ADHD on top of all that, which my family has NEVER cared for or understood. Never got any help. 

I'm turning 30 in just a few months and I have never had a job. My therapist says he truly does not think I ever will, and I don't either, but I can't even say that to my family because they'd flip out about it. 

The focus of my therapist is to help me get to a place where things aren't completely unbearable and I am wanting to die every second of every day. Getting to that would be a miracle on its own. Because that is exactly what my days are like. Most have no idea because of the level of masking I've been doing for so long. I told someone before my therapist about one of the events that happened to me, and she told me she was shocked, because looking at me you'd never think what I was carrying around. 

I'm forced to live with my parents again, because of a very nasty divorce. I've been divorced twice and each of those marriages were absolute hell. To the point I don't know if I will ever be able to trust another man in my life. I also have lost all hope and belief in love overall. I don't have any reason to be alive. You know why I'm still here? Because I am too much of f\*\*king coward to do it. When I tried it in the past, I got so terrified of the pain, that I have never been able to go through with something like that again. I'm scared of the physical pain of dying, but I am being tortured inside already from the mental and emotional pain within from living. Can't win. 

I told my therapist this and he was happy that I'm too scared of trying anything. He says that's a great thing about me. I disagree. Because all I am waiting for now is to die. Great life huh? How am amazing for not being able to to do it? How am I amazing for being a coward? 

I don't ever want to have kids, because I recognize that I am far too broken for it (despite how many times I've been asked that question it will never change) and honestly? I am still a child inside myself. In my country it's not a thing but I know I have age dysphoria. My internal age was stunted. 

I have wished so badly to at least find the love of my life, someone to share this life with, but that never happened. Only met people that have used and taken advantage of me. If there is someone out there for me, then he has not been incarnated into this world. He doesn't exist here, and it seems I am punished to suffer through this life completely on my own. Because if he is out there, we should have met already. Everyone in my family met theirs way younger than what I am now. 

I am always compared to my older brothers who have their shit figured out. They have their own families and own life. They're doing great. Meanwhile I am nothing. Haven't managed to do anything in my life. Nothing at all. They always say ""Get a job already. How are you still depressed? All that stuff happened ages ago, let it go!"". 

They don't even know half of what I've been through and even the things they think they know, isn't even the full story. If they had known how I actually felt, instead of just constantly calling me ""Lazy"", I wonder if they would have been so quick to pick on me. 

Also. Do they think trauma just disappears or something? I am tomorrow going to for the first time EVER, start getting help for my traumas.. doubt WET will help, but I chose that rather than talking verbally. At least this therapist is taking me seriously and sees how bad I am doing. Many in the past would dismiss me or I'd be pushed around to different health organizations stuff (difficult to translate what they were called etc) . 

Think about just how long this shit has been haunting me for years on end and then it only adding in more and more traumatic events as years pass by, and I'm supposed to ""just move on""? Hah, very funny. I am still having nightmares about things that happened years ago. Things that have affected my life in such a negative way, that if I heard someone else tell me about my stuff. I'd say ""how....how are you still alive?"". I hate myself. I hate how that little girl in me is still holding on to some sort of miracle that I know well enough will never happen. There isn't ever going to be knight in shining armor, and although I've tried to be my own knight in shining armor the past two years, it's not working. I have no energy left and cheering myself on, being there for myself like I wish someone else would have been since childhood, it has proven extremely difficult. How do you even do that when you're barely functioning already to go through the day? 

I just hope my next life will be better, because this one, there's no helping it anymore. I lost everything that has ever mattered to me. Gave everything of myself to people that manipulated me the entire time, only to stab me in the heart, full aware of what I had been through in the past. The only time it seems I haven't attracted these type of people is through isolation. Recently I caught myself getting ensnared in a situation with someone that felt awfully familiar. I pulled back immediately and have not spoken to them since. I'm proud of myself for that at least. Finally I was able to actually see a red flag in the very beginning. Every other time in the past it seemed to have gone over my head. Only problem is that, I now am more alone than I ever have been in my entire life. 

The only friend I have is moving away in a few months which means I'll have no one, not a single person to hang out with from time to time. I wish her the best, and I'm happy for her that she has found someone who cares for and loves her.

I didn't think I could hit a lower low, but this year has proven me wrong. The only thing I use to cope through this hell is daydreaming, doom scrolling and watching shows. Not exactly healthy things to this extent, but if it keeps me from going crazy, then it's better than nothing. 

I feel like damaged goods. I feel dirty, I feel gross, ashamed. My body keeps getting older yet I am staying the same, and although I know I should not think about it. I saw a post on facebook a while back where a bunch of people called women in my age and older who haven't found someone by now, that we are the leftovers and worthless. That nobody wanted us. That there's something wrong with us. That no man would ever want me now, because I'm not beautiful or young enough, not a virgin. Not to mention the baggage... they probably would run at this point. 

Because I've lost all of that and never experienced what it feels like to actually have a healthy and loving relationship where two people love eachother. Where intimacy feels pleasurable. Where you're not just used as a plaything or forced to it. I don't know how that is like, and probably never will. I'm sorry if that sounds very negative. In the past when I've even mentioned the smallest of thing about how I feel it's met with the ""Well, if you think that way, then you are manifesting it, so therefore you will suffer more. You have to think positive and so many doors will open up. It's up to you."" That always makes me feel bad and guilty. Like everything that has ever happened is my fault. 

Hearing someone say ""think positively"" has never worked. It's the same as saying ""stop being depressed"". I don't even know what the point is with this post. I wish I had never been born. My parents got me 11 years after my older brother. 13 after my oldest brother. By then mom was already 41 and I think now in retrospect, they should never have had another child. They never should have had me. Aside from everything else already mentioned, I was born with several holes in my heart and had to do a heart surgery at 1 years old. Then also another around 12 years or so. My heart condition is called Fallots tetrad. Most of my first years of life was spent in the hospital. I was always mocked for not being as fast or could keep up as long as everyone else. No matter how much I tried. I know from what my doctors said I'll have another surgery in the future. Since no one else in my family or relatives has this, I wonder if it was because of her getting me at that age. She was a smoker too though. No one has autism or adhd either, so I'm in a family of neurotypicals which has even more so made me feel like the black sheep of the family. 

I guess in all this hell, I'll work with my therapist to get to a place someday where my life isn't complete and utter despair like it has been, as mentioned. If that doesn't work. Well. I guess I'll die alone as an old woman in her home (please future, let me have a cat that loves me and I can spoil rotten, give me that at least, I don't know how much I can take) if I survive for that long. Who knows. Maybe something takes me from this world before that so I don't have to suffer anymore. All I do is survive and that takes everything out of me. 

I wish things were different...",1,0,0,something irritates people say things get better hang life change used believe used think right nope things get better know know ive depressed since years old

1j52m67,1741286406.0,"I'm not even able to think what I wanted to say, went through a lot, losing someone close, being cheated upon, betrayed by friends, bullied through the school, loudness of silence and idk what. Today, I lost everything, ofcourse my family is there but I don't have courage to tell them. 

and the only person I trusted the most, I opened up, shared everything ended up hurting the most. All these life, I'm told to share it, trust people and now by the same person I'm being mocked upon. Imagine being mocked by your support system on your mental health. Honestly, even I know I'm not making any sense at the moment maybe I never did. 

But today I'm told by my best friend about her change in behaviour, I'm not going into any details but the thing which hurt me the most was when she mentioned, ""bc when you were back to consciousness, the first thing you wanted was to talk to me"" in response to when I asked her why she broke off the friendship of 7 years ? just bc someone told her that if something happens to this guy, you'll be blamed. 

I'm sorry I don't know why I wrote it here. I'm sorry to bother you all, being so stupid, it was probably my mistake at all that I trusted someone more than myself. I'm not even sure why I well ig idk best wishes to everyone.

1j529zd,1741285579.0,I'm so confused about how I'm reacting to this. I recently ran out of my Prozac and didn't have it in me to contact the doctor so I just tapered and quit until my next scheduled appointment. I'm feeling absolutely great and I'm so damn confused. I know this stuff tends to numb you and I definitely agree but it's like that period of being numb is now allowing me to actually enjoy things I used to now that I'm off. It slowly improved over a few weeks. It started with intrusive thoughts that I almost forgot about. But some of those intrusive thoughts pushed me to do something about it. It's really strange and hard to put into words. I should also clarify that I'm also on clonidine for anxiety (still takin). Somehow this combination worked together to get me thinking differently. I'm shocked that I actually feel good in general. I'm blown away. I do have cycles so maybe they just aligned somehow ,1,1,0,im confused im reacting recently ran prozac didnt contact doctor tapered quit next scheduled appointment im feeling absolutely great im damn confused know stuff tends numb definitely agree like period numb allowing actually enjoy things used im slowly improved weeks started intrusive thoughts almost forgot intrusive thoughts pushed something really strange hard put words also clarify im also clonidine anxiety still takin somehow combination worked together get thinking differently im shocked actually feel good general im blown away cycles maybe aligned somehow
1j51dkq,1741283370.0,"I have accepted that life lacks all meaning when it comes to existencialism and that the only “meaningful” way to live it is by just, well, keep living it and building our own way around it. I have thought about the fact that we get to live what, maybe 90 years? And we will be dead for all eternity so why not giving it a shot, right?. That used to calm me down when being suicidal, but it doesn’t work anymore. It has become more of a mantra i tell people who are suicidal because I know it feels like absolute shit, and I wanna help them. Personally, however, i just think im too scared to kill myself due to instincts, that’s the only thing keeping my life besides not wanting to hurt my family by killing myself. I feel like a total failure, everything I do, someone did it better, everything I try to succeed at i end up failing at. Growing up I realized i wasnt going anywhere: Loneliness has become part of my daily life, i spend more time talking with myself than talking with other human beings. I used to think people didn’t understand me but ive come to the realization that im just an uninteresting human being who spends everyday daydreaming instead of getting shit done. “Then get shit done”, countless times ive heard that advice and i know thats what i have to do, but fuck it, I dont wanna, i wanna finish my degree to prove myself i wasnt the pathetic loser i thought i was and then die and be forgotten by everyone. Every pretty thing i have, i feel like i dont deserve it, the only thing keeping me sane is music, i make music and i listen to music all day, everyday, and repeat. Im surrounded by friends, I love them, they, along with my family, are my everything, but i feel dead, completely numb. I don’t remember how long lasting happiness feels like, and i dont mean like hanging out with friends and laughing until it hurts, i do have those moments, which i cherish with all my heart. I mean that feeling of going to sleep and wanting to wake up next day. I go to sleep wishing i die, or at least not waking up. Days go by like seconds and im wasting away.

I wanna smoke a pack today and not wake up tomorrow. I don’t want to make a huge effort just to be happy like a normal fucking human being. I’d love to wake up tomorrow feeling hopeful for the future, but it aint happening. Im somewhat smart i guess, and by that i mean i get good grades at uni, sometimes, at least im not failing my classes. Im ugly, yeah, a fact which i have accepted to be my own fault, i could be more attractive i guess if i put effort into it, but shit, is this gonna be a constant fight with life without being able to just relax for a day not feeling like a doomed creature? Shit man, it feels like i wasnt made for this.

There are times when I don't know what else to say to him and I feel that being with him so much is starting to affect me, for the worse. He also broke up with his girlfriend in the midst of all this, which is good because she was a bad person, but now he's feeling bad about it too. Today I'm going to go to his house with another friend because I'm talking to his ex and yesterday our soccer team lost an important game and he was pretty down.

and then i worry that ill regret going, then have to do the whole walk home again instead of being able to get home quickly and unwind. not to mention the library reminds me of someone who has left my life and im trying to take my mind off of them — i want to go for the sake of my mental health but because of this it might just make it worse.

1j4ywc7,1741277213.0,"I (25M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (23F) for about a year and a half. She lived with me for nine months before recently entering inpatient treatment for her CPTSD, PTSD, depression, autism, and emotional regulation disorders. Her treatment will last another 8.5 months.

Before she went into treatment, she always made it clear how much she loved me. We have so many beautiful memories together—vacations, football games, fun outings, and silly moments. Right before she left, she told me how much she would miss me and how sad she was to be apart. Even with all her struggles, she always made me feel special.

Now that she’s in treatment, she is working through her traumas. A therapist told her that she’s so overwhelmed with heavy emotions that she can’t experience positive ones right now. I understand that, but I’m really struggling with how one-sided our relationship feels at the moment. I miss her, I want to spend time with her, and I want to feel close to her—but I don’t feel the same effort from her side. She never asks to see me, barely shows affection, and seems emotionally distant.

She’s only three kilometers (about two miles) away, and my work is nearby. Before treatment, she said she loved that I’d be close so she could visit me. But now, nothing happens. When I tell her I feel unimportant or sad, she responds so emotionlessly. She says she’s just trying to survive, and I do believe her—but at the same time, it’s really tough for me.

I know she’s capable of positive emotions because I’ve seen it before, but right now, everything feels so heavy. This situation is making me doubt things, and I just don’t know what to do. I’m just really sad, and knowing this will last for another 8.5 months makes it even harder.

Has anyone been through something similar? Do you have any advice?

TL;DR: My girlfriend (23F) is in inpatient treatment for CPTSD, PTSD, depression, autism, and emotional regulation issues. Her treatment will last another 8.5 months. Before treatment, she was very loving and affectionate, but now she’s emotionally distant and doesn’t seem to want to see me. I miss her a lot, and our relationship feels very one-sided.

1j4ueo3,1741264308.0,"Posting this because i feel like im old enough to have complete control over my mental state, but the truth is, i dont and i just wanna know if there is anybody out there whos going through this too. 

Ive been self harming since i was 15. I live with my parents since im still getting my degree and living outside is not an option.

I’ve been clean for 3 years and had started to self harm again after minor and insignificant arguments with my parents. Ive always had a rough time with my parents since adolescence and im considered to be the most “problematic” child because i call them out of their bullshit multiple times. Things on my childhood neglect, being mentally abusive etc. but damn bro, they can REALLY twist my words and make me seem like the villain. 

My mother even said once, along the lines that “i like to make up things in my head, and i like to think of things that dont exist” that was the tipping point of my clean streak. 

Then a few more disagreements like that would always make me fall back to self harm and i hate it. All my hard work, I shouldn’t fall back like this. 

I hate how they always have the way to make me look and feel like im SUCH a major disappointment in their lives and theyre SOOOO much better than me and i’ll never live up to them. I hate how small i feel regardless of my age because every time I call them out their bullshit, i just feel 15 again. 

More on my dad: I just thought he didn’t give me any respect because i was a teen/kid with my teen/kid interests and intellectualism but as i grow older now approaching my mid 20s, he doesnt change at all, in fact, he became worse. 

Im going to law school and because his circle involves the law and he knows a few a lawyers, he thinks hes the TOP DOG. He lectures me on concepts I’ve learned in pre-law and i didnt wanna look like a snob on my high horse (unlike somebody) so i just kept quiet. Or when he sees and irl crime he goes deep in law principles and doesn’t even let me talk. 

Ive tried talking to him multiple times, multiple conversations. If he doesn’t change then fuck it dont change 🤷‍♀️ (the funny thing is, he only does this with me, he doesn’t do this with my other siblings)

1j4u5pn,1741263422.0,"Hi everyone, I've been wondering why we are here (what the point of it all is). I've had suicidal ideation on and off for years (at least age 12, I'm 40 now). I've been going through it a lot recently. I honestly wish I didn't exist and hope my life ends soon. However, I've also noticed it's just a thought and the thoughts that were causing the pain aren't an exact representation/match of my life or what's going on.

 I think the trick when going through it is to realise it's not true.(easier said than done). It's not true that I'll be homeless, that I'm useless, not good enough or attractive enough, will always be single etc. In fact, life is unfolding according to its will rather than my will. As the thoughts change so does the way I feel change. 

The thought that's happening at any point is what is causing the feeling. I can't know what the future holds yet I dream about it and if it's a negative dream I suffer. If it's a positive thought I feel good. 

I hope this helps someone who might also be struggling and hasn't had this realization. Plan activities if you can. Even cleaning your room, car or house can help stop the train of thoughts that are causing suffering. You're probably a lot more attractive than you currently think you are. You probably have a lot moren going for you than your mind wants you to know about. 

Struggling with relationships? How do you feel in yourself with yourself, by yourself? Do you believe in yourself? If not, may I encourage  to do some inner child work (IFS is a fantastic modality). Basically, you want to start to give to yourself all the love, validation, acceptance and encouragement that you never received. Develop an internal voice that loves and supports you no matter what!!! Through thick and thin. A voice in you that just supports you all the way. 

If you're really going through it, I'm deeply sorry and would love to be able to help (suffering sucks). However,  sometimes we need to be with our suffering in order  to process it and move onwards. I learned how to give  myself a hug and massage myself with love...
 Imagine your signaling to the universe what you need and it may send a real person. My relationships have improved dramatically in the last 2 weeks since realizing it's not outside that's the problem but inisde (the way I feel and think about me). Sending you love, positivity, self kindnes, acceptance and encouragement. You can do this! You can have an awesome, wonderful life doing amazing fun things with beautiful, loving people 😁😘🤗

Hi, 
I am in a very difficult spot right now, and i didn't know what to do so am writing here. 

I was very good at studying until my 2nd year of bachelor's. That's all i knew how to do right. But then Covid happened and i think i also got burnt out and I can't study anymore. I also blindly did electrical engineering and i think i only knew how to study for the exams and no knowledge beyond that. 

I also come from India and i think living with my parents and the whole atmosphere got suffocating and i wanted to leave, i convinced my parents to let me do my masters in Germany. My parents help me with finaces. I moved 3 years ago here, started my masters in semiconductor technology. My grades were bad ( the first time i experienced this) and my mental health was shit...and therapy is difficult in Germany. I somehow found student jobs and started my mandatory research project ( goes for about 6 months) 2 years ago. Meanwhile i found an internship in a different city...I moved without submitting my report. 

At the intership at the beginning I was good but I started slacking and slacking..so after 10 months i could not continue there..I still hadn't submitted my report. I found a topic for my master Thesis and started it in September. 

It's the same cycle of being good at the beginning and slacking afterwards and i still can't write the report..

The research project is for 10 credits and I can't register my thesis without getting it. My dad also retired meanwhile and he has been trying to get me to finish my report but my supervisor hasn't replied to my question asking if I still can't submit it....

Today when I was talking to my dad...he told he will look for a teaching job in india for me and that I should try to finish my masters and return back...I asked him why and he told me i won't be finding a job anywhere else and without his help. 

This really really hurt me and it's also been bothering me since sometime that am taking so long to finish my masters... seeing how I have become a failure in life...and my own parents thinking I can't do good in life....I was the child that they thought would do good...but not anymore....and the fact that even now am not able to sit and write the stupid report...I don't know what to do.... I sometimes feel like it would be much easier if I don't exist....

I really eed to finish the report so atleast I can start applying for other jobs....

Could someone please atleast give me fake reassuring that it ll be fine and I don't have to move back to India ( because I really really can't, i think I will go insane if I move back home) ...I also could use some help with finishing the report.... please am very desperate......",1,0,0,could use advice kind words please hi difficult spot right didnt know writing good studying nd year bachelors thats knew right covid happened think also got burnt cant study anymore also blindly electrical engineering think knew study exams knowledge beyond also come india think living parents whole atmosphere got suffocating wanted leave convinced parents let masters germany parents help finaces moved years ago started masters semiconductor technology grades bad first time experienced mental health shitand therapy difficult germany somehow found student jobs started mandatory research project goes months years ago meanwhile found internship different cityi moved without submitting report intership beginning good started slacking slackingso months could continue therei still hadnt submitted report found topic master thesis started september cycle good beginning slacking afterwards still cant write report research project credits cant register thesis without getting dad also retired meanwhile trying get finish report supervisor hasnt replied question asking still cant submit today talking dadhe told look teaching job india try finish masters return backi asked told wont finding job anywhere else without help really really hurt also bothering since sometime taking long finish masters seeing become failure lifeand parents thinking cant good lifei child thought would goodbut anymoreand fact even able sit write stupid reporti dont know sometimes feel like would much easier dont exist really eed finish report atleast start applying jobs could someone please atleast give fake reassuring fine dont move back india really really cant think go insane move back home also could use help finishing report please desperate

I have no social life basically. I have 3 friends that I talk to atleast on a weekly basis, and that's it. Most of my friends i lost after high school, as it goes apparently. Especially people i've known since elementary school, they never wanted to be my friend after high school.

The majority of my day consists of playing video games, watching youtube videos or tv shows. I've been excercising because everyone says it's the fucking cure all for depression apparently. But that's it, besides some other niche interests. I have no outgoing interests really, which I feel like makes me undesirable and boring.

I've never had a relationship in my life, not for a lack of trying though. I tried a couple times with a couple crushes in high school, which ended terribly because I was alot more socially awkward than I am now. Recently I tried talking with one of my friends, friend, and we hung out with her friend, her, and I. Found out they both were toxic as fuck, and left me feeling like shit after they were insulting me constantly.

I'm so god damn lonely, it literally hurts every day. Like I feel it in my chest. I see people happy in real life, in tv shows, in movies, and it just makes me depressed and resent them for having what I don't.

1j4qnk3,1741248309.0,"Sometimes I just want to choke myself to death.

Theoretically, I can't; it is the given nature of humans to respond to threats, so instead, I just smash objects and choke my pillow. I got angry and aggressive even with the slightest trigger, but I didn't want to hurt anyone around me, so I tried to keep my mouth shut and lock myself up whenever I felt crazy.

A little bit of background. I was terribly sucks at social interaction, and during work, I was feeling useless. My boss was kind as they explained to me that I have to show more passion and that they cannot offer to extend my contract, which I agree with. However, I was somehow irritated with some of my seniors' words, and I kept replaying those words in my head to the point that it hurt my chest and exploded my head.

Whenever I recall that conversation, I just slapped myself really hard multiple times, and I got addicted to that; I just stopped slapping because I knew I could not die, and dealing with a dizzy head after torturing myself was not a good idea.

I don't want to blame anyone, as it is my choice after all, but having these unhealthy behaviors has taken a toll on my mental health and affects my job hunting. Now I dream every night about people speaking ill of me.

1j4ouoz,1741240714.0,"
My mood has been never constant in these few months, and mostly it's always full of guilt and shame about myself. 
I might have to give a background first so here it is-- 
I'm currently 18, a student, I was always a sincere and a disciplined student and got good grades throughout, but it's been changing now. 
I've always been an anxious person, but the anxiety I feel now is too much for me, theres panic attacks more frequently and quite a lot of crying comes with it. 
So I passed out my highschool and I decided to give an year for preparation of an entrance exam, it was going very smoothly during the start, but it started to crumble down later on. I chose to prepare online, that made me cut off all my connections with most of my friends, basically made me a bit isolated, I had my family of course. 
Everything had gotten overwhelming for me slowly, but I tried to push through. But now I don't feel like working at all, I'm trying to avoid it like anything, I feel like I'm being lazy and it's so pathetic but I'm not that kind of a person who is lazy at all. I've watched countless videos on how to be more productive, disciplined, etc thinking that I'm not disciplined enough, but something tells me that's not it.  I sleep too much sometimes and get random headaches, chest pains, etc. I know I have the potential to do it but I just can't and it's so frustrating. Whats more frustrating is that I don't understand what's wrong. Even as I write this I feel like I'm exaggerating and trying to pretend like something is wrong so it can become a good excuse for me being lazy, although my family has noticed it too, it's so confusing, forgive me for writing it all in a messy order. I feel like a failure in my own eyes, knowing that I could do it and yet I still couldn't hurts so so much.
P.S.- it's embarassing to say it but I don't wanna hide this, my consumption of pornographic content had increase quite a lot than before during a timespan of 2 months in between, although it's much less now, could that be playing a role in this? 

Why is this happening? Am I just overthinking and making it a big deal than it actually is? It does feel like I'm just making it seem real big. Or is it a problem? It would be great if I can get some guidance over this, or any of you guys have gone through it and would like to share please do so..

1j4n7u6,1741234826.0,"I can't shake the feeling that life has no meaning or purpose anymore.  
I keep romanticizing the past when you had to struggle for your survival in very real scenarios. Working jobs just for the benefit of the economy and having everything you've ever wanted at your fingertips when it comes to food, travel, technology to me really removes the joy of experiencing something new.

I've been diagnosed with depression, anxiety among some other diagnoses for \~10 years at this point and life seems to become more and more fake and abstract as time moves on, could in part be a byproduct of me growing older though.  
I've gone through all the stages of fixing my problems, drugs, medications, self help, working out, religion and the list goes on but I always keep coming back to the fact that it's not a me issue but a societal one.

I was raised as an atheist but was always encouraged to explore religion and belief, which I've done extensively but to no avail. I've always admired the mysticism and belief that religions and spirituality offer but I've also sadly always seen right through them.  
So to me it's not a surprise that spiritualism is on a steady decline but I genuinely feel like it's something people crave without necessarily knowing it. Having all the worlds information, news and explanations available at any moment makes the world feel so two-dimensional.

I know that it's very counterproductive to dream about times that I'll never experience, times where you had an immediate sense of purpose, a sense of mystery and community but it's all I can think about.  
And yes, I am well aware that life before was harsher in every sense and death was around every corner, I can't shake the feeling that life would have made more sense back then though.

I'm just tired of living without a purpose and feeling out of place.  
Tired of having to listen to conversations about day to day nothingness and having to witness greed and materialism consume society like a cancer.  
I feel like technology has taken over and life is secondary at this point, we're more connected than ever but I can't imagine we've been more isolated.

1j4mxjn,1741233869.0,"I got a bit tipsy tonight and went on a binge of some old cartoons I used to watch when I was younger, when I was suddenly hit with this overwhelming... weight. Like someone strapped boulders to my shoulders. And I realized how tired I was. Not just mentally or physically. That deep tired; the one you can feel in the core of your being. I'm three months into the most mentally intensive job I've ever had - one that I've gone to school for, gotten a degree to qualify for. But I'm not... happy. I can't revel in my accomplishments due to unresolved traumas. All I can see is responsibility. So much responsibility, stretching out over the horizon of years. And where does it all lead? More work? More stress? More responsibility?

I'm tired of being responsible. I'm tired of going from one goalpost to the next, always running forward, never pausing for breath. I can't pause, even if I wanted. I'm wired to keep going until it's done, even if I know it never will be. I'm tired of looking at my future and never seeing a point where I can just stop for a while and... I don't know. Lose my worries? My stress and anxiety? Part of me wishes, as much as my childhood was a special kind of emotional Hell, that I could go back to a time when this weight wasn't crushing me.

1j4mxcu,1741233853.0,"I had been married for 8 years. We have 2 very happy, bubbly children. 
Me and him come from completely different cultures and family dynamics so our marriage absolutely had it's challenges, but also its beautiful moments.
To the outside world, we were the perfect happy family. 
On the inside, our castle started to fall apart very rapidly.

With multiple promotions at work, his stress levels increased drastically and he started to lash out on me (verbally, never physically) and became completely emotionally withdrawn. Affection and passion become non existent. 
An emotionally strong woman would have most likely helped him overcome his stress or maybe put him in his place for snapping at her at home.
But not me. I silently fell into a depression. 

I did look for help and was prescribed a low dose of antidepressants to see if that would help. And it did, initially. 
Until it didn't. 
My husband didn't change his ways (and refused any sort of marriage counseling) and I finally had terrifying suicidal attacks, complete mania, even in front of my children. 
I. Had. To. Die. 

I luckily had found the strength to put my kids in the back of the car and drive myself to the emergency department, where my kids were handed over to my husband and I got admitted into the psych ward.
Diagnosis: Severe depression, ADHD, PMDD, mania, Bipolar Disorder. 
I got medicated for all of the above and after a week in an empty room, I was sent home.

Now I was back home, with the knowledge that I'm completely mentally unstable, left my kids traumatized and a husband who is now terrified that I'll get another mania attack any minute, so he withdraws even further away from me by sleeping in the other side of the house. 

I felt lonely and defeated. 
I saw my husband, or at least the bad combination of my mental health problems and his tough ways, as the source of my suicidal attacks. 
I still can't fully explain it, but the medication had completely changed my ways. I became very superficial and selfish and only cared about my own happiness.

I found a job (I had been a housewife for years).
Made a ton of new friends.
Worked out daily and dressed sexy.
Started going out at least 3 times a week with them.
Fell in love with someone else.
And the cherry on top of the cake: I decided to leave my family to live alone

My life had been saved. Though I got divorced and didnt get custody over my children, I overcame my depression. I was happier than ever. For a full year I felt completely stable. My kids stayed over at my house in the weekends and we had more fun in one weekend than in their entire life while I was depressed. 
I felt so incredibly perfectly happy after making  such a big lifestyle change, that it was time to stop my medication and take over myself to continue this happy path.

Boy, was I wrong.

It's now been 2 months off of meds, and suddenly the realization hits. What have I done?
I don't have custody over my kids? What?
I got divorced. Was that really necessary?
Couldn't we have worked something out? Shouldn't I have stayed?
I have left my husband and my kids for selfish reasons. 
I won't be able to bring them to bed and read them bedtime stories.
I won't be there when they come home from school with happy or sad stories from their day.
I won't be able to help them with their homework.
My kids are still so very young, but they will grow up to hate me.

1j4m5bw,1741231261.0,"I know this will sound weird and extremely random, there are so many people who probably need more help than i am and i know im probably having an anxiety episode, but if nobody sees this, i at least vented? I don't know, im desperate at this point.

So, as the tittle says, I'm 16, turning 17 this year and ""just realized i have depression"". 

I actually knew this been quite a while, I have no idea when it started but i know that when i was 12, i started having depressive symtoms(not showering, forgetting to eat and sleeping a lot). This has been my normal for a while, unfortunately, i try every day to do all of the above tho, and i never really let myself """"lack off"""".

However, today I just realized what being depressive meant for me. I, somehow, never realized what this meant for me, i thought it just meant i wasnt as happy as other people, but i just realized that this, in my case, makes me unable to do so much in my life.

The reason for desperation now is this:
I cant have access to any kind of professional help, so dont even mention it.
I have no job, i will finish high school this year but my grades are being carried by my best friend who also has lots of stuff going on, and in general im being a burden to everyone.

My best friend, my mom and my siblings all do so much for me and im so grateful but i dont want that because it just makes me feel even worse about myself, and im too weak and a coward to actually try to fight this.

In all honesty, i wished time was completely gone, this would probably fix all my problems.

But this isn't possible, and i dont have a job to help my family, and my mom doesnt wants me to drop off school(she wants me to graduate and go to an university)

I know my mom's vision on psychological health probably affected me more than i would like to admit, since she thinks people with depression are just people who let their sadness to win over.

I wished i could fight this depression, but im only able to do so when im having energy peaks, and i usually use that to do things that only give me happiness with not much effort(drawning, playing games and etc.) I feel so useless right now and i just want an easy way to stop burdening people, because i dont have the strength to do any big plans.

I dont want to die, neither do i have self-harm-ish thoughts, but i feel like im going to die if i keep this way. I want to be stronger for my family and friends but i feel so useless.

1j4ku99,1741227269.0,"What counts as a suicidal thought? I’ve (18) been thinking about stabbing myself for the past 2 weeks, sometimes really convincing myself that I should but then I don’t. 

I’ve had suicidal idealization before but I don’t really remember it?? It’s just something my therapist has down, since it was the reason I went to a psychward in the 8th grade. I know they’re concerning, and I’ve been showing signs of genuinely wanting to do it. It feels right to give away my stuff, I feel better at the thought of dying, but do these thoughts count as suicidal thoughts? 

I’ve done research on where to stab, or if I’m too scared to do that to go with my plan b.

1j4kg81,1741226131.0,"This isn't really about me, just something i thought from time to time that i heard back when i was in high school.

Personally i got social anxiety and really reflect on most interactions i have with everyone and i live by the rule of treat everyone like you would treat yourself so i would consider myself at least a bit sympathetic to most people.

Thing is remember hearing in high school a group of people that were in my class talking about a girl who killed herself in a bathtub slashing her wrists with glass or something and a guy said that she probably was just too ""weak and its probably for the better"" and i think the people agreeed because i don't remember anyone complaing about it or saying he was wrong.

How are some people's head so stuck in their ass to say shit like that? It feels sickening to me that there's people so cruel and worst of all most people i've seen like that end up in high power places like good jobs or being able to be in relationships.

Is sympathy simply seen as a hinderance in this world?",3,1,0,isnt really something thought time time heard back high school personally got social anxiety really reflect interactions everyone live rule treat everyone like would treat would consider least bit sympathetic people thing remember hearing high school group people class talking girl killed bathtub slashing wrists glass something guy said probably weak probably better think people agreeed dont remember anyone complaing saying wrong peoples head stuck ass say shit like feels sickening theres people cruel worst people ive seen like end high power places like good jobs able relationships sympathy simply seen hinderance world

1j4ke0z,1741225949.0,"Hello,
Thank you in advance for any comments/advice. I was just asked by my mother if I was mad at my sister bc I haven't spoken to her in weeks due to my depression and secluding myself from everyone. I've been slowly trying to physically feel better after an illness that's lasted years and started a new anti-depressant in the last few weeks. 
Since I heard this, I have felt more sad/depressed and taking it out on my husband when we have been doing so well in recent weeks with no arguments, but since the call we have been on each others nerves. 
My husband says I should just address it directly with her to see what her issue is (there were no prior arguments/issues with us). The only issue is that last night I came to the realization that myself and my family always think that everyone has an ulterior motive and I'm skeptical on her motives of bringing my parents into her own insecurity.
Sorry for the rambling, but I have been emotionally affected since hearing this.

1j4kbhi,1741225734.0,"Since yesterday I’ve been beyond irritable. Anytime I can’t get anything right I start to think about hurting myself or smashing something so it could hurt me in the process. I don’t know for sure if my mom understands how bad it’s getting. Cause when I mentioned taking a break from work she immediately downplayed the idea so I just don’t think she gets it. And I don’t think I have the heart to tell her that. I don’t know if I can tell anyone. Cause I’m just so scared they’re gonna worry 24/7. My mom is already worried since I spend an hour crying yesterday. But I just don’t know if she gets it. I’m scared if i open up to people they’ll change how they’ll treat me. I don’t want that. I just want an outlet. But at the same time I feel it’s coming to a point I need someone to know to watch out for anything cause each day I’m thinking of ways I could go through with hurting myself and it’s not good. 

I don’t know what to do cause I’m scared it’s gonna get to the point one day. But I’m hopefully I’ll carry out towards spring break. I’m beyond relieved it’s coming. And I need it. I’ve been having tests for the past four weeks on top of this week and next. And it’s just not helpful. It’s one test after another which is really stressful on top of being burnt out. I’m just ready for the break. One more week I keep telling myself. But it just feels like school will never end. 

I’m hoping after spring break I won’t be so overwhelmed but I have a feeling it’s gonna be abt the same amount. But this week has just been build up from the past three months. Or so I’m hoping. 

I wish my school implemented mental health days. There are many times this semester I’ve needed one but can’t take it.

I'm not suicidal. I just lost a friend to suicide and the unimaginable pain that's caused has not made this any easier. His pain has just been spread to his loved ones me included.
